"another @allplants out of the freezer
accidentally defrosted it before I saw it said it was ‘best served frozen’ which would have been more ideal for me
I added some peas and a mix of microwaveable cauliflower florets and broccoli 
all sprinkled with my seeds mix

not sure why but i’m slightly scared of microwaving anything but frozen peas

according to scientific research, broccoli specifically should be steamed so the nutrients can be best absorbed
I bet you the margins are so small it wouldn’t really even make a difference whether you microwaved or steamed it

there’s always 500 other meals in the future that I can catch up on in my micronutrient profile if I think the broccoli this time is lacking 

I want to get onto frozen meals more but they’re always a faff and require the slightest bit of organisation which I don’t have when i’m working however ‘defrost from frozen’ has given me hope that I can just whip it out the fridge and straight in the microwave with no fuss

very delicious meal overall from allplants
mushrooms were slightly on the chewy side
rice was a bit ‘fragile’
but it had a nice creamy and thick sauce
tasted like a childhood meal for some reason - nostalgic
good flavours
tight portion control but think the portion size is right (even if I initially thought it would be a bit small) because then I can fill any empty space with my own veggies 
felt satisfied from this meal whether it was from the added bulk of greens or the meal itself, I am happy

"VEGAN HAINANESE 'CHICKEN' RICE

Hainanese chicken rice was one of my favourite dishes in my pre-vegan days. Once a while i will crave for it especially the fragrant rice. That's why I must learn to veganize this dish so I can prepare it for myself whenever I crave for it. 

To recreate this dish the vegan way is not really that difficult.  Usually ppl are using bean curd skin to make the 'chicken', I opted king oyster mushrooms which makes surprisingly satisfying swap in both texture and taste, and it's easier to prepare too. Please see my story highlight for the recipes and step-by-step guide.

Accompanying this dish are the 3 main sauces:
1. Chili sauce
2. Scallion ginger sauce
3. Soy sauce

As I'm making a non-allium version of Hainanese 'chicken' rice, coriander is used in the ginger sauce instead of scallions. Here's the recipe:

CHILI SAUCE
4 Red Chilli (deseeded)
3 Bird's Eye Chilli (or more)
25g Ginger
30g Calamansi Juice 
2 tsp Brown Rice Vinegar 
1 tsp Salt
1/2 Tbsp Raw Cane Sugar (adjust to your liking)
4 Tbsp Cooking Stock (recipe on my story highlight)
1 Tbsp Sesame Oil 

To make the sauce, simply blend all ingredients in a blender until a smooth sauce consistency. 

○○○

CORIANDER GINGER SAUCE 
100g Coriander (finely chopped)
180g Minced Ginger
100g Cooking Oil
1/2 tsp Sea Salt
1/4 tsp @loveearthorganic Mushroom Seasoning 

Method:
1. Heat up oil in a skillet over medium-low heat.
2. Add ginger and coriander, stir-fry 10-15 minutes until you get a fragrant, pesto consistency sauce.
3. Season the sauce to your liking.

○○○

SOY SAUCE 
1/4 cup Cooking Stock 
1/4 cup Light Soy Sauce (i used tamari)
2-4g Raw Cane Sugar (adjust accordingly)
1/2 Tbsp Sesame Oil

Mix all the ingredients in a small bowl. To be served with rice and mushrooms. 

○○○
Hope you like the recipes. Tag me if you make the dish, i would love to see your creation. 

Happy Sunday everyone.

"PEPERNOTEN! 🇳🇱 Today (5 december) is national holiday 'Sinterklaasfeest'. Pepernoten or kruidnoten are a traditional snack we eat during this holiday. They do have a strange name since peper means pepper and noten means nuts.

"🌿Did I mention we're going vegan?! Well only for a week or two (at least that's what the boys think 🤫) The intention was vegetarian initially but friends recommended @allplants so we figured we'd give them a go. We're both tired, run down and clinging on until Christmas so having healthy meals ready in the freezer meals one less thing to do in the evening after work. It'll stop us reaching for the takeaway menu so that can only be a good thing!

I hardly ate any meat when I met my partner and have been trying for several years to convince him and my son that they can in fact survive without meat at lunch AND dinner EVERY day. They've never listened 🙄 I've tried introducing meat free meals occasionally and having one meat free day a week but with no progress so now they're both going cold turkey (as it were). No meat for at least one week, possibly two and maybe more if I get my way 😁 (I've nothing against us eating some meat - as long as it's free range and ideally locally sourced - but I just want us to get in the habit of having loads of veg first...)

We're also cutting out dairy products too, which those who know me well appreciate is a biggie 😳 I'm a cheese monster. This part will be rough 😬😢

Yesterday's BBQ burrito bowl was YUMMY though (even without cheese) 💚 We bulked it out with frozen veg and a pita since it's meant for two and there's three of us. Tasted scrummy and even though the little boy didn't eat that much he did try everything and didn't complain too much. He'll be the hardest to crack I think as he's firmly in resistance mode. The bigger one is vaguely on board and wolfed it down happily enough ☺️

"@latifs_inspired BALTI CURRY gone PLANTBASED!! 💚🤩💚🤩

VIRTUALLY FAT FREE,  VEGAN,  GLUTEN FREE,  TOTALLY YUM!!!

Curry is my all-time favourite food.  I just love it so much and have been cooking it for many years. Needless to say  when I found Latif's YouTube channel (latifs inspired) a year ago I was Instantly hooked.  Such a wonderful British-Indian chef who loves his food, his craft and authentic world cuisines. He's dedicated his channel to sharing that passion.  Many of his videos are shot in his restaurant kitchen (or Mum's Kitchen - love that!) Showing us how to cook authentic curry house style food. It's heaven for me - i just can't get enough 🤣

Anyway,  as a WFPB eater with hypercholesterolemia, I need to avoid oil/ fats as much as i can so I've started to experiment with de-oiling some of my favourite Indian recipes, this being the best of the lot.

This balti is true to Latif's word, so I hope he's not offended by my effort. I include the tomato puree (recipe and how to make also on his channel), but leave out the ghee and Anchor Butter (!! - i know...) and obviously tikka chicken, replacing with extra veggies. I also replace his base gravy with water, although one of these days I'm going to make it!  The only place oil gets in is via the ready made balti paste, which I really don't like using but haven't come across an oil free one yet 😕 -  IF YOU DO HAVE A RECIPE PLEASE SHARE!! 🙏. 

Do check out Latif's video on 'How to make CT balti Indian restaurant style'. He uses his own balti paste - the recipe for which he doesn't share, but hey, he has to keep some pearls up his sleeve! - instead he recommends a good authentic shop bought alternative, which i do use. 

Hopefully if enough of us vegans support him,  he'll start to make us some vegan recipes!! 🤣👌💚💚... Like if you agree👍 😍

This dish is one of my husbands all-time favourite dinners. I made it for him last night cos he's been good. 😁😁

Happy Thursday All!

I've had the tiramisu cheesecake and this vanilla berry cheesecake was delicious too! 🍰

It's been nice having a lovely @allplants dinner followed by the a yummy dessert so I highly recommend adding them to your delivery if you're already a customer!

"Had this Protein bowl from @allplants last night. Absolutely scrummy, filling and only 530cals. 
I use Allplants when my health issues peak and these meals are a life saver. No more reverting to oven baked ""beige"" food when what I really need is good, wholesome plant food. Highly recommend (and can refer for money off - DM)

"Soo Heart healthy GREEN MAYONNAISE!!
Zero added oil; bazillion cruciferous hugs 🤗 💚🤗💚
VEGAN,  WFPB, GLUTEN FREE,  VERY LOW FAT.

I've been working on something to put in a sandwich that isn't hummus. I LOVE hummus but sometimes i just don't want it... I need a different flavour.  As someone who's damaged her circulatory system over years and years of poor eating - hammering home the fats and sugars - I now need to be extra careful with what i eat. I'm on a mission to reverse the damage 💪 

This little pot of goodness is my answer (the recipe makes loads more than this so less of the little, actually). I'm SO pleased with it,  Its 95% cruciferous vegetables for maximum nitric oxide punch,  yet has such a thick and smooth creamy texture, like mayo!

ALSO it's a fab substitute for guacamole if,  like me,  you need to watch your avo intake because of the fat content 🥑🥑

FINALLY,  just when it couldn't get any better... triple  bonus... it's amazing hot! So is totally yum smothered over pasta!! 

Visit my blog & recipe page - link in my bio - later today!! 😁

Happy 'slightly lightened up' Lockdown Lift  day UK! 🇬🇧

I’m loving the chocolate #tiudonuts I made at the weekend for my M2 snack this week 😋 also just tried my first @allplants dinner; they are a plant based meal delivery service & today was my fave Mac & greens. Very tasty whilst also being relatively healthy.  Great for weekday evenings when I’m getting a bit bored of all of this home cooking.
.
I’m going to give this 25 days of TIU a try - who’s with me? I got in a mile walk at lunch today going to collect some Xmas pressies from a local business 😇
.
Some goals for the next 25 days:
🥇 spend less time on my phone. I’ve got really bad at just picking it up to stare at it recently even when there’s nothing to see. Going to try throwing it in another room in the evenings and sticking to my bedtime setting where it silences my alerts
🥈 make an effort to check in with my friends and family ahead of the holidays.  Give more time to others
🥉 stick to healthy food choices 80% of the time especially when I’m at home the week before Xmas (Xmas itself doesn’t count 😜)

"Great post by @davidclearyveganpt⁠
⁠
Seitan vs Steak - Which is better?🤔⁠
⁠
Guest post from Claudette over on @_healthyvegantips ⁠
⁠
Be sure to follow Claudette for for more nutrition, wellness, and vegan information! 🥬⁠
⁠
So often I am told that I am missing out by not eating steak. Which is just not true. Seitan is a plant-based, cruelty-free alternative to red meat that is just delicious!⁠
⁠
🥩Steak is farmed through meat factories where the cows are usually pumped full of hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. ⁠
⁠
Not only are cows treated awfully but red meat may also come with a whole host of other health conditions.⁠
⁠
From a nutritional point, steak has 204 calories per 100g, it's high in saturated fat and cholesterol. ⁠
⁠
While it does contain 30g of protein it's also cruel to animals and awful for the environment.⁠
⁠
🌱On the other side, Seitan is a plant-based alternative that is cruelty-free and sustainable. ⁠
⁠
Seitan is made from hydrated gluten. Wheat flour and water are kneaded together to produce strands of gluten that are full of protein. The starch is then washed away.⁠
⁠
Seitan often mimics the taste of whatever you would like, which makes it incredibly versatile. 🙌⁠
⁠
From a nutritional view seitan only has 106 calories per 100g and is low in carbs, fat, and cholesterol while still providing you with 21g of protein.⁠
⁠
It's also packed full of vitamins.⁠
⁠
There are many alternatives to red meat that you can choose that are jam-packed with nutritional value. 👊⁠
⁠
Comment below what is your favorite meal with seitan! 👇⁠

"Even if it's not the first meal that come in your mind when thinking about italian cuisine, pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans) it's a staple of the italian cuisine! (At least it was before the meat boom, now only vegans eat it😅🙈) 
Homemade wholegrain pasta with beans, garlic, bay leaves and rosemary. Olive oil will complete this simple, delicious, nutrient meal. I added an insanely amount of hot chilli flakes. This gal loves her food hot!

"A week of @allplants ready meals😋

1. Bhaji Dahl - so flavourful and had such a nice texture to it! 10/10
2. Protein Power Bowl - My favourite surprisingly! I was expecting it to be a mix of too many flavours but this was so tasty and ofc very nutritious 👅 10/10
3. Mushroom and Chickpea Korma - a little watery to begin with but mixed it well and it blended okay, the flavours weren’t quite as strong as the other dishes and felt like quite a small portion...but it was still delicious! 7/10 
4. Shepherd’s Pie - couldn’t resist adding this to the box, it was better than I expected ~ not watery at all, such a nice texture and had a nice crust on top, 10/10.
5. Creamy Mushroom Stroganoff - really nice flavours but didn’t love the texture, quite watery / grainy and not as ‘creamy’ as I would have liked. 4/10 😕

Overall very happy that I tried some more of their dishes! I think it’s worth doing once a month if you’re busy, for a week of pain free dinners & for the flavour and nutritional value. I’d say the two portion option is better value for money though 💷

"Deck the halls, y'all! Liquid Peppermint Patty for lunch! 🍬

Something I just learned:
DID YOU KNOW that to give our digestive system a rest, it is good to DRINK one meal day?

But before some of you get too excited 🥂 🍻 🤪 be sure the drink includes fiber, protein, a little fat and antioxidants. ☺️ 

My family is in love with the powders we use to make our smoothies and shakes. It’s all plant🌱based and predigested and rich in healthy fiber and plant protein, and even includes some fat and other plant-based nutrients and antioxidants! It's called Complete because it contains complete amino acid profile - it’s clean burning fuel. 

Healthy plant🌱smoothies help to energize you, strengthen your immune system and keep you “regular”! Smoothies are one of the easiest (and fun and delish) ways I’ve found to add more plants to our diet. 

Message me if you want to join friends and I for 12 Days of Smoothies where we will share one favorite cold and hot healthy recipe a day for 12 days starting Dec 1st.

"SUPERFOOD APPLE & BLACKBERRY SMOOTHIE for brekkie this morning! 

It was hard work putting up the Christmas decks at the weekend with a permanent glass of fizz in hand... but I battled on through, trooper that I am 😉 

Now of course my body is asking for some TLC so I'm responding with a huge glass of soothing fresh super food smoothie. 💚🤗💚

Believe it or not,  this is more of a green smoothie than red (see next pic for ingredients plate) but it came out a beautiful wintry mulberry colour! How fab 🤩🤩

There's a whole Cox apple in this.  Core,  pips and everything blended together with kale,  broccoli,  cucumber, lime juice and celery. I added a slice of fresh ginger with its skin, 1/2 tsp turmeric and 1 tbsp ground flax seeds before adding the frozen blackberries!! Totally YUM 👌

🎄🎄As we head into the festive season keep an ear out for what your own body's asking for to balance out the excesses. 

Be kind to yourself. Hope this inspires 🙏💚

Keep well

"By picking apart many recipes to get all the flavors and ingredient ratios down to a science, I have put together my own plant based chickun recipe! 🍗

After laboriously kneading the seitan chickun dough until firm, I wrapped and sealed it up so I could simmer it underwater until cooked throughout. (Baking seitan is also an option)
It then sat in the fridge for a while to firm up and cool down.

I whipped up 3 nostaglic dishes with this meaty plant based delicacy:

1. Home-made cheddar cheeze chickun casadillas with salsa and easy sour cream. 🧀🍅

2. Crunchy chickun salad wraps. 🌯👌

And last but not least..

3. Heart warming chickun corn chowder. 🌽🥔

Eventually I will share this recipe for all but until then you'll have to do your best with what's out there.

"Finally got round to buying the proper Korean pepper powder to make my own kimchi.  Fermented foods are incredibly good for gut health and as well as that - taste amazing.  I love kimchi on the side of any salad or noodle dish, also in kimchi fried rice and it’s epic in a cheese and kimchi toastie.  I read what felt like a million different recipes on Pinterest and in the end I’ve picked all the bits I liked the best to come up with this approach! Definitely not for the purists! Anyway; take a small Chinese leaf cabbage and slice how you like - I like mine quite chunky but some people like it shredded.... I then also added a bunch of finely sliced radish.  In a bowl add a brine of 1/3rd cup of salt and 2/3rd cup of water.  Swish around and then leave for around an hour until the cabbage leaves have wilted.  In the meantime make the flavours.  In a blender add half a chopped onion and lots of garlic- I used half of a large bulb of garlic - Chuck in 1/2 cup of water and blend.  Pour this into a bowl and add 1/4 cup of the gochugaru - Korean red pepper powder, a bunch of finely chopped spring onions and my addition - a big chunk of ginger finely sliced.  Mix all these ingredients together well.  After an hour drain and rinse the cabbage and radishes to wash off the salt.  If you have a glove you might want to use it now! Add the red pepper paste mix to the drained cabbage and use your hands to make sure all the cabbage is coated in the pungent sauce.  Pack into a clean glass jar with a lid and leave to ferment for 12-24 hours.  At this point you can taste it and check if it’s how you like it and then transfer to the fridge where it will keep for a long time - can’t wait to see how this tastes tomorrow.... trust me to make something this powerful just as lockdown is coming to an end!

"Heart-Healthy MUSHROOM PATE on toast anyone?!

💚 Vegan, fat free & WFPB 💚

Try this super easy recipe for something wholesome,  mega tasty and homemade for lunch:

INGREDIENTS & METHOD:

- Simply dry fry 3.5 cups sliced mushrooms with a splash of dry sherry or water to stop them drying out. I used portobellos for maximum flavour 👌

-Add a tbsp white miso paste. 

- One minute before they're done (dry and cooked through), add one large sliced green onion/ spring onion, 1 tbsp chopped parsley and season with black pepper. 

- transfer the whole lot to a food processor and add 2/3 cup beans of your choice - i used black eyed beans, 2/3 cup silken tofu,  1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp mushroom ketchup or Healthy Boy mushroom soy sauce.

- whizz to a smooth consistency,  taste and season with a pinch of salt and black pepper to suit your taste. Transfer to a lidded container and chill for at least 1 hour to let settle, firm up. 

So Yum just piled on top of fresh crusty bread or spread on wholegrain sourdough toast with cucumber and/or tomato.

Happy Friday, Al!

"PEAS MASH with ROCKET & RED ONION GRAVY! 

Vegan,  no fat or oil,  gluten gree,  WFPB...

So yum and comforting for a cold autumn evening tea.  I've used organic new potatoes here and roughly mashed them with a fork to keep texture. But if you prefer silky smooth 'old' potatoes, do remember to leave the skins on.  There's so much goodness and fibre in spud skins and they add so much extra flavour! 

I added a little nooch, garlic powder, white miso paste and black pepper  for seasoning and a dash of cashew milk to loosen. 

Then added the peas in (still frozen) at the end along with the chopped rocket. The heat from the potatoes is sufficient to defrost and warm them through. You don't need to cook frozen peas,  they're best when they taste like they've just come straight out the pod. Plus they keep their amazing vivid green colour!! 💚💚

Really quick and easy this one - a weekday evening no brainer. 😎

Stay safe & well

"IT'S A RED PEPPER SOUP day...
With beluga lentils! 

I featured this recipe back around Halloween and added a detailed description of how to make it on my blog @ genlively.com.  We love it so much in our house it's a weekly staple. 

Stuffed full of vine ripened organic tomatoes, plump red bell peppers and red onions,  it's a real celebration of all things red and green (like Christmas!! 🎅🎄👍)

I switch it up now and then by sprinkling in different textures  like these beluga lentils and serving with different breads - always a good sized chunk of wholegrain something... sourdough,  rosemary,  seeded,  walnut and its great with Indian roti! 👌👌 

Other great additions are cooked brown rice or pearl barley and if you swap out the basil for coriander it wanders off into a whole different continent! 🌎

So rich, filling and versatile - it satisfies appetites for lunch OR dinner! 🥣🥣🥣

"Here again with a gorgeous lunch! I enjoyed every single bite of it! A great quiche made with onion, oyster mushrooms and endive. The filling was made with fresh herbs, chickpea flour and just an invisible pinch of black salt 🤣🙈. Crust is half wholegrain floor and brown rice flour. Steamed green beans as side. I'd have another slice😆😆

"Christmas Deliciousness for everyone! This year we have everything you need for the Perfect Plant-Based Christmas, whether you're catering for a crowd, or need options for a few! 

Our Wine Poached Beetroot Wellington makes the perfect centrepiece for a hungry family. It weighs 1.8kg and will feed 6 to 8 people. Catering for less? Try our individual Mushroom Wellingtons (with truffle and pecan stuffing! Yum!) Or for a gluten-free option, our Truffle Risotto Stuffed Artichokes! 

But our favourite this year? The Wild Rice, Pecan and Cranberry Stuffed Butternut! It'll feed four to six people and it's sooooo good.

Oh, and we haven't forgotten about dessert! We have the most amazing Chocolate & Raspberry Yule Log created by pastry chef extraordinaire Kirsten and a double layered, completely plant-based, passionfruit pavlova!

"Salads for your freezer? Who knew! This is one of our favourite new inventions, Green Bean, Farro & Chermoula Salad. We cook use nutty, chewy farro as a filling base, then add green beans, edamame, currants and lightly sauteed celery, then toss through a spicy chermoula dressing! 

Chermoula is a spicy dressing of cumin and coriander that originates in a Northern African countries like Morocco Algeria & Tunisia. It's complex, a little spicy and delicious!

Our salad is a perfect side dish for a hot summery night, or a light meal for one or two for lunch.

"Ain’t no mountain pie enough! 🥧🎶 
• •
With such a huge amount of vegan options you can’t go past @mountainhighpies and not grab a pie. I tried most of the the vegan options there but my favourite savoury pastries were definitely the Dhansak Lentil Curry Pie with its lightly curried and hearty filling along with the vegetable sausage roll, which was filled with peas, cauliflower and quinoa - both had a fantastic flaky pasty. For a sweet treat be sure the grab the apple pie - it’s more of a crumbly shortcrust pastry. If you’re a tart food lover go for the apple rhubarb pie!

"RAW COURGETTI with BASIL,  WALNUT AND ROCKET PESTO for tea tonight!

vegan,  Wfpb & no added oil!

Am craving something clean and fresh, which is odd considering the weather 🤔 🌧No idea what that's all about but am going with it! 😂

I whizzed up:
- 1 cup fresh basil
1 cup rocket
1 garlic clove
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1tsp white miso paste
Juice of a lemon
1/3 cup toasted walnuts
Freshly milled black pepper 
And a drop of water to get it moving.

Worked it through 2 spiralised courgettes with my hands and left to macerate for 10 mins. 

Sprinkled with a little crushed pink peppercorns. 

Hope it inspires 🤗

Have a good evening,  All

"FESTIVE  PLANTY BAUBLES!! 🎄🎄

Little treats with no added oil or fat!

Well,  I wouldn't normally bring these out until we were respectably into December but this year early Christmas mood enhancers are more important than being respectable. And just to underline that... I've dusted some with beetroot powder for the more 'out there' among us and included a little Cointreau for the naughties. I know,  steady on! 😂🤭 

The beetroot powder is for those with less of a sweet tooth. It's earthy but weirdly works and just looks amazing!! I've dusted them with Waitrose Signature Spice Sparkling Sprinkling Snow,  which isn't WFPB but the tiny amount is totally worth it in my opinion just to get them twinkling 💖💖

INGREDIENTS:
- 2 whole medium carrots
- 7 medjool dates
- 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit including citrus peels
- 1/4 cup ground almonds
- 4 tbsp cacao powder
- 1 cup oats
- 2 tsp cointreau or zest of a small orange
- 2 tbsp flax meal
- 1 tsp cinnamon 
--------
For Coating:
- Chopped roasted hazelnuts
- Desiccated coconut
- Cacao powder & coconut sugar (1:1) mixed
- Beetroot powder 

Mince the ingredients in a food processor till they start to clump together.   If too wet, add more oats a tbsp at a time. If too dry, add half a ripe banana or a little more carrot. 

Turn out into a mixing bowl. Refrigerate 10 mins to let settle and firm up. 

Using a teaspoon,  scoop small amounts out and form into little balls about 1 inch diameter. 

Roll each ball liberally around in one of the four coatings,  place carefully on a plate and set in the fridge for 6-12 hours to firm right up. 

Will you give them a go?! Don't forget to Like/ comment below!

"GARLICKY MIXED MUSHROOMS on sourdough toast with avo and wilted spinach 🍄🥑 🍞 

So easy! And so potent for fighting colds, 'flus and viruses this winter. 

NO ADDED OIL Or FAT,  so incredibly heart healthy, too! *

Just layer up:

- Toasted wholewheat sourdough
- Sliced half an avocado
- Wilted spinach with a squirt of liquid aminos
- Pan dry-fried portobello,  oyster and shiitake mushrooms (or any mushrooms you have in) with a crushed clove of garlic chopped parsley and black pepper!!

* If you have a heart disease related condition omit the avocado as it contains fats.  Instead, you could substitute with a tahini free hummus or oil free pesto or just leave it out.  It'll still taste delicious!!*

Enjoy!

"DID YOU KNOW... that plain white mushrooms grow up to be portobellos? Apparently they’re the same mushroom! (I learn something every day 🤷‍♀️)

But however grown-up they are, they ALL contain immunity boosting myconutritents with anti-inflammatory properties that help protect against cancers, heart disease and allergies – particularly those of the respiratory tract!

- Oyster mushrooms hold the highest levels of Ergothioneine, a potent essential amino acid that protects cells from cancer-inducing free radicals. 

- And, Shiitake mushrooms, which contain many of the same amino acids as meat, boost the immune system, lower blood cholesterol levels, and help to fight cancers.

These medicinal properties are heat stable (withstands cooking) and get right to the heart of every cell to guard our DNA and mitochondria.

 So, you can’t go wrong by regularly adding a range of different mushrooms to your diet… Get creative!

Happy Mushroom Monday, All 😊
 
Stay safe & well

"MILLET CAULIFLOWER MASH

Millet and cauliflower florets are blended together, seasoned with gomashio, served with shitake-hijiki gravy. A wonderful healthy alternative to the usual mashed potatoes. 

Does it tastes identical to mashed potatoes? NO.
Is it still delicious? You bet.

Recipe and method on my story highlight - Mashed ""Potato""

Thank you 👇👇 for the wonderful products.

To make it too:

Chop 1 small squash and roast it for 30 mins with 1 peeled chopped sweet potato,  1 red onion, 1 red pepper, and a sprinkling of garlic salt. 

Once soft (about 30 mins), add it to the vitamix with:

- 4 tbsp rendang curry paste
- 1 tsp vegan fish sauce
- 1 tbsp tamari
And whizz till smooth...

Then heat the whole lot through  in a pan with water to get it to the right consistency.

"MISO TOFU CHEESE

 A wonderful cheese substitute that is so easy to make and yet delicious.  You can have it as a snack or sprinkle on pizza, salad...Or make into sauce or spread. It goes very well with wine too. 

Here's how you make miso tofu cheese.

1. Spread a layer of miso over the tofu to cover all sides.
2. Place it in a container and refrigerate for 1 (dark miso) to 3 days (white miso).

Hope you try the recipe. 

Happy Cooking.

"VEGAN MACARONS

Learning how to make vegan macarons is a big and long journey as vegan macarons are so particular in their own special way. Some methods work for some people, but might not work for others. You just have to find your own style and keep practicing, keep making inevitable mistakes, learn from mistakes, fine tune the method & recipe and not giving up!

Have not been making macarons for quite a while, luckily still remember the steps. I've had a few batches of rough vegan macarons before showing this photo. Not quite there yet but at least i feel the progress with each batch.

"Plant-forward or not, it can be super fun to experiment with plant-based recipes and see how similar of an experience you can get with different ingredients. I felt like making a sweet treat tonight so we baked up some donuts inspired by a donut recipe in Isa Chandra’s I Can Cook Vegan cookbook (I made them oil free and still perfection). These are all plant-based ingredients (and w/whole wheat and oat flour, unrefined coconut sugar) and baked, not fried. So super yummy.😋 Have there been foods you’ve tried recreating plant-based that have been especially surprising, delicious and fun?❤️

"Hello hello! Welcome to my instagram, the place where I will share my recipes, tips that help stay on track and much more.

I enjoyed a plantbased, gluten free and processed-sugarfree diet for about 5 years now. I had a lot of ups and downs through the years, tried to be raw vegan several times and because of my current health situation, this time I 🥕commited🥕 to the raw vegan lifestyle. I know of its' healing power from the past, transitioning this time was very hard for me but so far it looks bright! 

My account will be one of the tools for me to stay on track, to have everything in one place and if it would bring inspiration and hope to someone of you, that would be the greatest gift ❤️ Wishing you much love 💞🌱

"So as I WAS meant to be back at work after 7 months off, I was a bit worried I would slip into old habits of not cooking in the evenings and just resorting to takeaways. (Which is fine every now and then but I get so lazy so easily!) So I did an order from @allplants so that we would have some healthy(ish) vegan ready meals to throw in the oven after long days at work. 

Turns out I then got furloughed again 😂🙈 so I have all the time in the world to cook BUT these meals are still super handy! We had the rigatoni carbonara last week and it was super tasty 👌🏼 It wasn’t the most cheesy but it was nice and creamy.

In terms of the service itself it was pretty good. You can select a day for delivery, you keep the meals frozen and then they take 15 mins in the microwave or 45 mins in the oven. Only downside is you technically have to “subscribe” but you can unsubscribe at any point. 

We have 5 other meals still to try so I’ll keep you posted on how they are. 

This is in no way sponsored or anything by the way, I just thought I’d let you all know what I thought in case anyone was interested!",149,"['#vegan #veganinstaclub #veganmeals #veganfood #veganrecipes #veganpasta #pasta #italian #italianfood #veganitalian #plantbased #plantbasedmeals #plantbasedfood #dinner #vegandinner #dinnerinspo #allplants #food #foodie #ilovefood #healthy #easy', 'This looks delicious 😍', 'Look at the creaminess 🤤⭐', 'That looks so good']",allplants
"I was wondering if I could feed my child a vegan diet for a day without him noticing, and the short answer is yes.
I’m not sure why I set it up like that because the long answer is essentially also yes. 
The breakfast, lunch and snacks are all pretty standard for him, I just swapped out the cereal bar and skipped butter on the toast, neither of which raised an eyebrow (and he does raise them often and impressively). Green veg risotto is one of his favourite dinners too; he did realise it was a different one and brought it up very diplomatically, so sorry @allplants but he prefers the dairy version we usually have! Granted, if I cooked a vegan risotto from scratch we could amend the seasoning to his tastes. 
Tl;dr, it was easy to have a vegan day and I’ll probably repeat the experiment soon 🌿🌱🌾

Breakfast: Coco Shreddies with Alpro Junior soya milk and a banana

Lunch: Beans on granary toast

Snacks: Vegan cereal bar and a pear

Dinner: @allplants super green risotto with an unpictured fruit roll-up for dessert

"Food glorious food! 🤗 I posted over on my story a poll for wether you wanted to see what was inside my @allplants box and the general consensus was to crack it open. So here we are! 

I’ve being suffering with a mild case of food envy recently, everyone seems to get fancy food boxes which have some tasty looking dishes. So I hopped on the bandwagon and @allplants was my choice as they’d been lurking in my emails for a while. 

I took me what felt like 10 hours to choose as I’m possibly the most indecisive person. Eventually I ended up with spinach and nut ricotta lasagne, bhaji dahl, polpette orzo, teriyaki udon noodles, nacho bean chilli and rigatoni carbonara. But I didn’t stop there as there was a pud section.... so a sticky toffee pudding and tiramisu cheesecake may have also slipped in my order 🙈 

Now I spent a grand total of £14 on this haul because I had a £20 off. Such a steal. Let me know if you wanna give an #allplantsboxie a go and I’ll drop you a code 💸

"Adaptogens and CBD make the perfect pair. But wait, what the hell are adaptogens?⁠
⁠
Basically, they're herbs and plants that help you manage stress better. They protect your body from stress by decreasing your sensitivity to stressors.⁠
⁠
Not all plants are adaptogens. To be considered adaptogenic, a plant must meet the following criteria:⁠
⁠
🌿Helps the body resist stress⁠
🌿Must maintain homeostasis⁠
🌿Must be non-toxic⁠
⁠
One of our favorite adaptogens is reishi, pictured here. It's known for its sedative and calming effects. It doesn't just help you stay asleep, it can actually help you fall asleep faster.⁠

"Vegan pepperoni mushroom pizza pockets with my home made cheddar cheeze!
🍕🍄🧀
The pepperoni used was left over from when I made it the other day. Fresh mushrooms and bell peppers were also added on top of a crushed pineapple tomato sauce.🍍 🍅🤤
The cheeze I made is a combination of recipes that I tweaked to my liking. 
 The taste is very mild from what I was expecting, kind of like perogy  filling. It's a recipe I'm still working on. It passed the shred test but I think its needs to be a little more melty and stretchy. 
The dough is regular pizza dough that my girlfriend made. 😊
We also thought to make a ranchy like sauce to dip these in
OVERALL these turned out AMAZING, and super nostalgic!

Dr. Forrelli is a naturopathic physician with over two decades of experience formulating supplements. Inspired by the idea of holistic performance, Taryn developed a line of botanical supplements designed to remove physical and mental barriers to flow, enhance experiences, optimize recovery, and support the holistic wellness needs of outdoor athletes. ⁠

Her approach is best summed up in her own words––⁠
“Nature awakens our senses, optimizes our physiology, and presents challenging physical obstacles that make for the most exhilarating experiences – ones that make us feel completely alive, immersed in the moment, relieved of stress, and full of confidence.

"HAZELNUT. GULA MELAKA. DARK CHOCOLATE. VEGAN.

Some people have a notion that vegans only eat bland and tasteless vegetables and salads. But what most people unaware is that every food, meal or treat that we love can be made vegan, including desserts, cookies....and they are just as good.

My students always ask what food I miss the most after going vegan. Fish? Beef? Cheese? My answer is always ""NON"". I'm the happiest veggie lover you will ever meet.

""Do you miss cakes?"" NO. I make nice vegan cakes.

"Breakfast sandwiches with salsa, HOMEMADE FRIED VEGGS, HOMEMADE BACUN AND HOMEMADE MOZZA. 
😁👌
These were the BEST breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.
🍳
Usually I just wing the ingredients in the yolk and it turns out pretty good but this time it wasn't thick enough so I added some tapioca starch and it turned into sort of a cheeze on top of the white which was delectable. These eggs were made from stuff like rice flour, plain nut milk, tomatoes, oil, nutritional yeast and spices.
* I accidentally used basil infused oil in the yolk which turned out to be a great idea!
 🥓
Bacun was made from marinated, spicy bean curd roll from an Asian market.
🧀
Mozza was made from boiled cashews, tapioca starch, coconut oil, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, nutritional yeast and more 😉

"Shout out to @gazoakley for this AMAZING, perfectly unbeatable pepperoni recipe made from all of the pictured ingredients.
🧄🧂🍷🌶🔪🧀🍕
Getting the special ingredients for this recipe was SO worth it. 
It turned out very meaty and spicy with hints of red wine and smokey, sweet spices. It also kind of had a deer sausage like vibe.

I've made seitan before but this recipe was a game changer for me. The pepperoni is not only incredibly realistic looking but also in taste and texture, getting a little chewier every day.
I also played with a mozzarella style cheese recipe to distribute around the pizza which melted into heavenly pools of cheezy goodness all on a crispy thin crust made by my girlfriend 😊🤤

"Beautiful mindful walk today in the forest at Delamere.  We walked several miles in beautiful weather and were well and truly forest bathed! Research has demonstrated that spending time in a forest can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and anger; strengthen the immune system; improve cardiovascular and metabolic health; and boost overall well-being.  The benefits come from the chemicals plants produce called phytoncides. These chemicals are natural oils that plants use to defend themselves against unwanted pests such as insects, bacteria or fungi.
Phytoncides improve the human immune system by increasing natural killer cell activity. These cells respond rapidly to virus-infected cells and tumour formation. Studies show that increased natural cell activity can last for more than 30 days after a trip to a forest, suggesting that a trip once a month is enough to help you to maintain a higher level of natural killer cell activity. Other benefits from phytoncides include an increase in anti-cancer proteins; a reduction in blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormones; reduced test scores for anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion; and increased scores for energy levels.  Now more then ever we all need to take care of our immunity 😷 #forest #forestphotography #forestbathing #forestwalk #breathedeep #immunityboost #shinrinyoku #mindfulwalking #livewell #behealthy #lockdownliving #selfcare #plantbased #allplants #green #phytoncide #plantpowered #plantfueled #getclosertonature #treehugger",21,['Gorgeous pics.

Over a dozen studies report that the simple act of being in nature decreases negative emotions––such as anger, fatigue, and sadness––while also enhancing positive emotions, such as energy and joy. ⁠

Being outside also optimizes our physiology––reducing blood pressure, enhancing immune functions, and decreasing the stress hormone, cortisol. ⁠

Rigatoni carbonara: 5/10 the pasta was a bit hard and the sauce very liquidy and was slightly lacking in flavour but was creamy so there’s that!! 

Three mushroom risotto: 5/10 the addition of walnuts wasn’t personally needed and created a slightly weird texture and again it was lacking in flavour 🌱🌱

"🧡 THE MOST DELICIOUS TOFU 🧡
... you‘ll find the ingredients here👇
Aus Tofu kann man ja wirklich so einige köstliche Gerichte kreieren... ich habe lange an der richtigen Rezeptur für diese Marinade getüftelt, bis sie einfach perfekt war.
Wichtig ist, dass ihr das Wasser aus dem Tofu rauspresst, so dass er beim Anbraten richtig knusprig wird ( Tipp: Tofu in Küchenrolle einwickelt und z.B. mit einem Topf für etwa 1 Std. beschweren )
Für die Marinade vermische ich Sesamöl, Sojasauce, Erdnussbutter, Chilipulver, Knoblauchpulver, Koriander- und Ingwerpulver, Limettensaft, Salz und Pfeffer miteinander.
Die Marinade gebe ich dann über den Tofu, den ich vorher in Quadrate geschnitten habe.
Doch richtig knusprig wird der Tofu erst mit Kichererbsenmehl... sobald der Tofu von allen Seiten mariniert ist, das Mehl gleichmäßig darübergeben und in Sesamöl von beiden Seiten knusprig anbraten.
Noch etwas Sojasauce, Sesamöl und Frühlingszwiebeln über dem Tofu verteilen... Guten Appetit!
Was ist euer liebstes Tofu-Rezept?🧡🌱

🧡 THE MOST DELICIOUS TOFU 🧡
... you‘ll find the ingredients here👇
You can really create some delicious dishes from tofu... I spent a long time working on the right recipe for this marinade until it was just perfect.
It is important that you squeeze the water out of the tofu so that it becomes really crispy when seared (tip: wrap the tofu in a kitchen roll and weigh it down with a saucepan for about 1 hour, for example)
For the marinade, I mix sesame oil, soy sauce, peanut butter, chili powder, garlic powder, coriander and ginger powder, lime juice, salt and pepper with each other.
I then pour the marinade over the tofu, which I cut into squares beforehand.
But the tofu only gets really crispy with chickpea flour... as soon as the tofu is marinated on all sides, pour the flour evenly over it and fry both sides in sesame oil until crispy.
Spread a little more soy sauce, sesame oil and spring onions over the tofu... Bon appetit!

⠀
Fermentation is one of the oldest techniques for preserving food, and interestingly is now proving to be one of the healthiest. Learn how to turn your diet into a probiotic powerhouse.⠀
⠀
In this virtual workshop you will learn how to use your hands to create and tend to the live ferment over a few days, before putting it into your fridge. After which, you’ll be able to create many ferments of your own – the varieties are truly endless.⠀
⠀
A low-cost, no-waste process, it is a collective homage to our elders who knew the necessities of preservation.⠀

This weekend and it's the same plant, same price.  Now I asked but no discount.  But I still love the colors.  So.... if I survived a week at @acehardware under those conditions, it would love my garden area lol

So I bought it.  It's still just a beautiful (potentially) as I imagined it.  So let's see if I can save And nurture this plant back to life for next spring

"Wow such a busy few days! Lots of family and sibling halloween set-ups! We have loved getting creative and thinking up quite a few different Halloween themes, I can’t wait to share the rest of them with you.

We couldn’t exactly find what we wanted for our ‘Be Spooky Fun’ Halloween so I decided to design my own cushions and accessories. 

Googly eyes are the main theme for this one, incase you couldn’t guess! Each tent; Mummy, Daddy’s and Ethans all had their own spider web with their names on, googly eyes and spider. 

Ethan’s mum also ordered our spooky midnight feast boxes, I personalised these to match the cushions and place settings.

A bit of a change around as Ethan was supposed to be having 2 friends over to stay but with the new rule changes mum and dad have stepped in to have a cosy spooky family night!

"Being a #memon myself I miss all the memoni dishes in #Dubai so so much. And I have never come across a restaurant who offers authentic memoni #cusines!

But but but I was surprised to get this #package from @memondarbar.ae which tasted exactlyyyy like back in home! I actually had a tear in my eyes when I took my first bite. Because it was yummy and tasted very different from the food we normally have here!

They sent me their #feastbox which is for Aed 149 and good for four people. The quantity was huge! They are doing deliveries and catering for gatherings so life is sorted♥️

Review:
-Khawsa 9.5/10 (very spicy and extremely well made)
-Biryani 10/10 (exactly like #Karachi ki daigi #biryani plus with #aloo🙈)
- Daal Chawal 10/10 (spicy and very unique)
-Pulao 10/10 (Excellent spices)
-Zafrani Kheer (Hasan ate in one go🙈)
-Zarda (it was to die for and was with #gulabjamun🙈)

Overall it was an excellent Experience! Loved the packaging so so much. I love how packages are sent so thoughfully♥️
.
They are located in Ajman and delivering in Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman.♥️ Get your hand on it now! Thanks @memondarbar.ae for feeding us such delicious food!

I’ve loved trying out recipe boxes over the last few months and last week I received a  delivery from @feastboxuk, a brilliant company who send recipe boxes with unique global dishes and easy-to-follow instructions.

May we introduce to you the Trinity Feast Box! Alongside our handmade chocolates and cakes, we’re offering these for local home delivery and they’re already proving to be super popular. They’re going to be a permanent feature on our menu but we plan to tweak them regularly to keep things interesting. They’ll also be available from @trinitymarkethull when things finally return to normal so you can enjoy them with family and friends in the market’s seating area (or to take away of course).
.
We’re down to our last available few for next week’s delivery so if you fancy trying one you’ll need to be quick! Just head to our website (link in bio). Oh and we’ve also got 5 to give away to key workers so if you’d like to nominate someone, you can do so on our Facebook page.

"🇬🇧/🇸🇰 🥟I always wanted to be able to prepare some exotic dishes that I only tried in restaurants - Chinese dumplings for example. Thanks to @feastboxuk 📦 I was able to do that at home! Feast box is a home delivery recipe box that delivers all the ingredients fresh and pre-measured so all you have to do is to follow their recipe 📝 The menu offer changes every week and you can always choose some vegetarian or vegan 🌱 options too. What I liked the most about Feast box is that they offer popular dishes from all around the world 🌍 so you can get to try new things, new cuisines and interesting flavours that you probably wouldn’t be able to prepare at home otherwise 🤷🏼‍♀️ These pork dumpling were amazing and although they weren’t perfectly shaped I was so proud of myself that I was able to make something like that myself ☺️ If this is something you might be interested to try, use my code janeyfood20 to get £20 off your first two boxes. You can find the swipe up link in my stories today and tomorrow which will take you directly to the Feast box website. Their menu will change again soon so if you want to try these pork dumplings, don’t hesitate any longer 😜

🥟Robili ste niekedy takéto čínske taštičky? Ja som ich vždy mala len v reštaurácii a veľmi som si želala, aby som raz niečo podobné vedela spraviť doma. A dnes sa mi to podarilo. Našla som si video na YouTube o tom, ako ich správne baliť a tvarovať, no moje cesto úplne nespolupracovala, tak som to trošku poňala na freestyle 😁 Plnené sú mletým bravčovým masom so shitake hríbami, jarnou cibuľkou, pak choi🥬, zázvorom, sójovou omáčkou, sezamovým olejom a shaoxing vínom. Urobila som ich asi troška viac dochrumkava, ale priateľ sa teda nesťažoval 😜 Čo vy, skúšate variť takéto medzinárodné špecialitky? 🤷🏼‍♀️

"We have got into a bit of a rut with dinner and I’ve been looking for some inspiration. We are quite adventurous but I like things that are easy to make, ideally something Erin can help me to prepare. Erin also doesn’t like things too spicy but she does like full flavours. There are lots of meal boxes out there and I think they are a great way to experiment with food - they provide the ingredients so you don’t need to worry about buying things you’ll never use again. This week we have tried @feastbox and chose musakhan chicken which is a Palastinian icon. Erin and prepared it together and I thought we can not go wrong with this! Once it was cooked it looked just like the picture and smelt amazing. I can report back that it tasted as good as it looked too!! The kids and me really enjoyed dinner and it is definitely something we will have again. It has also encouraged me to try more @feastbox meals.  #cheltenhamblogger #parentingteens #cheltenhambloggers #ukmoneybloggers #gloucestershire #parentingteensblogger #lifewithkids #parentingteenagers #celebrateourteens #teacherblogger #gloucesterfoodies #moneysavingblogger #celebrateteenagers #bargainshopper #foodenvy #foodie #teenparentsupport #mealbox #mealboxes #feastbox #feastboxmeal",70,"['It looked amazing on your stories!', 'If you like it; chicken and chorizo paella is delicious. https://recipes.sainsburys.co.uk/recipes/main-courses/easy-chicken-and-chorizo-paella']",feastbox

"#AD |  One of my resolutions this year is to cook more at home. I set off on a mission to create a little mushroom based recipe. I love the texture and flavour they add to dishes.

I like to use mushrooms for a lot of things from salads to sandwiches, but my absolute favourite is pasta 🤤. Here are my ingredients: Mature cheddar, cream, parsley, chilli, mushrooms & sausage. YUM.

Did you know only 80g of mushrooms counts as your 1 per day?​ #BringOnTheBlend​ @JustAddMushrooms

"Sounds perfect to us too 👌 . • @fowlmouthsfood (AD) Duck ramen from @feastboxuk perfectly paired with @robinsons_uk Pressed Pear & Elderflower Fruit Cordial.

I'm a massive fan of squash. Robinsons Orange is my usual go-to, but they've got a slightly fancier cordials range which makes not drinking booze - be it for #DryJanuary or just reducing it in general - a lot of fun. Robinsons has teamed up with Feast Box this month, and their Duck Ramen was so easy to make and really tasty - and the freshness of the Fruit Cordial paired perfectly.

Feast Box are offering you 30% off their boxes by using the code MELISSA30. Give it a go - I was well impressed 🍜

"Recent I was lucky enough to receive a @feastboxuk box. Feast box is a home delivery recipe box which makes cooking authentic meals from all over the world accessible from your kitchen. In the box you’ll receive a recipe card with instructions that are broken down into easy steps so even beginners can try some ambitious meals. You’ll also receive all the ingredients you’ll need measured out so you’ll have no left over waste! This was something that attracted me to feastbox, I love the idea of something so convenient but also eco friendly. Along with being convenient, there are a variety of options available including at least 4 vegan recipes so it really is suitable for everyone! 
One of the meals I got sent was a duck dish and it was incredible. The steps were really clear and easy to follow and the end result was amazing. If you’re looking for some tasty at home food I’d definitely recommend Feast box. It was a life saver for me, I was supposed to go food shopping the night before but didn’t get chance so we had no food in for that night and I didn’t have time to go food shopping that night either. Having the feast box delivered meant we had amazing, fresh food without having to leave the house. 
You can use code ROSIEFEAST to get £10 off you’re first 2 boxes so £20 off!! I’ve included a link in my bio so go check them out! 💕

"At FeastBox we always try to choose wholegrain breads wherever possible in our menu items. Bread is a good source of carbohydrate, and is low in fat, and the wholegrain varieties
have the added benefit of additional protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals, as well as healthy fats. In particular, the dietary fibre
content of wholegrains helps to keep us fuller for longer and is
beneficial for our bowel health by preventing constipation and
feeding the ‘good’ gut bacteria.
​
Some kids have a propensity to choose white over wholemeal or
wholegrain bread, when given the choice. However, if you start
by switching over to wholemeal bread and then slowly introduce
wholegrain varieties as a regular feature of their diets, they just
might accept it and even learn to like it. Be mindful that parents
need to commit to it too, by modelling the eating behaviours
you want your kids to follow. If they just won’t have any of that,
then stick with white and choose hi-fibre varieties where
possible.",11,['#bswps #parentinghack #tuckshop #workingmums #mumhack #dadhack #schoollunches #healthyschoollunch #lunchbox #mumlife #healthyfood #feastinabox #brunswick #morelandmade #banyulebuiness #FeastBox\xa0#healthyschoollunch #lunchbox #kidslunchbox #schoollunchbox #healthylunchbox #melbourne #victoria #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #nutrition'],feastbox

"Ole!  It's a mexican fiesta for the next two weeks at FeastBox.  First up, your kids can take their pick from two versions of chilli con carne, a turkey one or a bean one.  Add some rice, corn chips and a little grated cheese and you've got one very tasty lunch.  Don't worry, our chilli actually contains no chilli... keeping it safe for younger palates.
​
They both contain good servings of a variety of veg, including onions, garlic, carrots, tomatoes, beans and red capsicum.  Red capsicum is a native plant of the America’s and is used widely throughout Mexican cuisine. We use it a lot in many of our dishes at FeastBox and is a mainstay in our vegie stick selection. The kids like it for its crisp and juicy sweetness.
​
​Red capsicum is nutritionally beneficial for a range of vitamins and minerals, and in particular it is an excellent source of vitamins A and C. Vitamin A is important for good vision, healthy skin and for supporting your immune system. Vitamin C is important for keeping your skin, bones and connective tissue healthy while helping to heal wounds and prevent infections. Eaten with iron-rich foods, vitamin C helps your body absorb iron at a much higher rate. ​
​Try adding red capsicum to your home-cooked mexican meals, stir-fry’s, salads, soups or stews, and get it in your kid’s FeastBox this week!",11,['#bswps #parentinghack #tuckshop #workingmums #mumhack #dadhack #schoollunches #healthyschoollunch #lunchbox #mumlife #healthyfood #feastinabox #brunswick #morelandmade #banyulebuiness #FeastBox\xa0#healthyschoollunch #lunchbox #kidslunchbox #schoollunchbox #healthylunchbox #melbourne #victoria #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur'],feastbox

"Did you know that cooked and cooled rice is a great source of resistant starch and that most Australian's are not consuming nearly enough?  Resistant starch helps to keep us regular while feeding the good bacteria in our gut.  Regular consumption helps reduce the risk of colon cancer, lowers our blood cholesterol and helps stabilise sugar levels in our bloodstream. 
Cooked and cooled fried rice is not only high in resistant starch, it is also a convenient way to pack in lots of veg, and that's how our rice rolls.  FeastBox fried rice has got generous helpings all of the classics - peas, corn, red capsicum, and spring onions.

"This week I want to share with you a little about myself and my latest campaign to help raise funds for the outdoor play spaces at BSWPS.

I’m a mum of three kids, two of which are already at BSWPS, and one more to start next year.  I’ve always had a passion for food and cooking, and even trained as a chef many years ago.  Since becoming a mother, I became much more interested in feeding my kids foods that would support their growth and high levels of energy.  So, a few years ago I left a career in GIS/Cartography and went back to uni to study nutrition.  After completing my studies, I wanted to use my knowledge to help other parents with the day to day grind of feeding kids well and empower our kids to make healthy food choices. FeastBox was born. 
I know how hard it can be some days to come up with meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in between.  Some days I don’t feel like I’m doing it well, and just seem to scrape by with whatever is in the cupboard or fall back on a local take-away meal.  We’re all doing the best we can.  I want to give you a break from all of this, just on Friday’s, so you can hit the pause button on lunchbox prep and feel relieved that your kids are still being well fed. 
I’m grateful to the BSWPS school council for endorsing and supporting my proposal to begin operating FeastBox in term 4 last year.  Coming up to the 1st anniversary I wanted to give back to the community that has helped FeastBox get off the ground, and so I’m running a special fundraising campaign for the remainder of term 3.  Every time you purchase a FeastBox we’ll donate $1 to the outdoor play spaces project. You can have a day off lunchbox prep, the kids get a healthy and delicious lunch, and you help raise funds for the school. Win, win, win!

Please support FeastBox to raise funds for BSWPS, and get your orders in today!

​Birthday's are a time for some treats, especially a good homemade cake.  But not all of us are master bakers or have time to spend on homemade endeavours.  Sending special birthday treats to school can also be a minefield to navigate, with school policies, and dietary and allergy restrictions to consider.

A slow cooked tomato ragu full of vegies and lentils lovingly coats penne pasta with a cheesy bechamel layer on top.  Baked so its golden and bubbling, this pasta bake is every bit as good as the original lasagne. ​
​If you just can't get enough of bechamel, then perhaps our other option will entice - a cheesy tuna, zucchini and tomato pasta bake.  Penne pasta is encased in a rich bechamel sauce, this time with tuna, zucchini and tomatoes tossed through.  With extra cheese on top, this one has a nice golden crunchy top and oozy cheesy middle.

We got to choose two dishes and went for a Green Thai Prawn Noodle Salad and Paneer Makhani. I had to leave the chilli out as we were going to try both dishes together but it still had such a wonderful flavour and abit of warmth. Elizabeth absolutely enjoyed the noodles... And she stole some paneer to add to her dish 😄

"You’ve probably gathered I love trying new things and experiences. As a busy parent and with a relatively new kitchen I’m spending more time now in the heart of the home. Food is of course essential and with variety being the spice of life I’ve been trying out the home delivery meal subscription @feastboxuk and jazzed up week night dinners. I struck gold with the recipes selected as they were easy to follow and the food was really👌🏽good and got the thumbs up in our household. I’m now a fan of the Middle Eastern spice zahtar and enjoyed using the bespoke pastes and spice blends. So if you’re stuck in a food rut and want to have a go at making authentic Asian and Middle Eastern meals, I highly recommend choosing these dinner kits delivered in eco friendly packaging. I even spotted recipes from the region of Gujarat where my parents are from. Love how flexible the subscription is so you can use it for as long or as little as you like. The food looks so colourful when presented and definitely great if you want to impress someone special 😉.

All of the ingredients are exactly  measured and sent to you based on your choice off the weekly menu, alongside very clear recipes. •

Based on the meals I picked I was excited to try out some ingredients I’d never cooked with myself like Fenugreek, Mustard, Broccoli, Duck, etc. The packaging was excellent, everything was fresh and I was so pleased! Recipe boxes are available from £4 per meal and works out excellent value. It’s great for busy families or individuals, single peeps, special guest hosting & even if you’re looking to just expand your palette and try some new cuisine. •

If you’ve seen our stories, you’ll see that we were sent a recipe box from Feast Box UK - it was a cute little Valentines ❤️👫 thing for us to do together, and this is what we made! 👨🏽‍🍳👩🏽‍🍳🍽️📝
.
Firstly, Feast Box is a home delivery recipe kit, providing authentic food boxes and meal kits! 🏡🚚 You get to pick recipes of your choices from their website,  and they will send you all the ingredients right to your door🚪, along with an easy step-by-step recipe guide! The best thing about it is that all the ingredients are fresh 🥗 and they send you exactly the amount that you would need for your recipe - meaning there’s no waste!! 👌💯 They cater traditional Asian and Middle Eastern recipes, and have such a lovely range - including vegetarian and vegan!! 🌿
. 
We were sent the recipe for the Turkish Filo Pie which is vegan 🌿 and it’s a Valentines recipe ❤️ - so it was definitely a fun and cute little cooking session for us to do together!👫 The Turkish Filo Pie has a filling of chickpeas, butternut squash and spinach, covered in lots of flaky filo pastry! 😍 Making this dish was so much fun - it was incredibly easy to follow the recipe, but it did take quite a bit of time ⌚ but that was the fun of it, as it was a cute little thing for us to do together as a couple! 👫❤️
.
The Turkish Filo Pie was definitely something new that we have never tried before! The filling was really tasty, and we were both surprised by how much we liked it, as we’re not huge fans of butternut squash! 👌 But the combination of the butternut squash with the spinach and chickpeas worked really well together, and there was so much flavour in it from all the spices! 😍🔥 The only thing we found was that the saffron was a little too overpowering, and sometimes that was all we could taste. 😕 The filo pastry on top was amazing; so crispy and flaky 😍👌, and there was such a contrast between the textures of the pie! However, we did find that the cooking time for us was increased as the filo pastry did not cook in some parts, in the time mentioned on the recipe card - this could just be due to different ovens! 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♀️ CAPTION CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS BELOW⬇️",379,"['We really enjoyed making this Turkish Filo Pie - it was really tasty, so much fun to make together as a little date 👫❤️, and so convenient and easy to make with all the ingredients being delivered to the door! 🚚🏡 We definitely recommend checking out Feast Box - and if you want to do some Valentines date night cooking together with no fuss, then Feast Box is definitely a cute idea! 🥰\n📢🌟 We also have an exclusive 40% off just for you all, so use the code FEAST40 on your next order!!

I made their vegetable lentil pilaf with Sumac roasted vegetables. All of the ingredients were provided with a recipe card. It only took around 30 mins to put the meal together, and it was delicious 😋I will certainly cook this again.

"If you follow my stories you’ve seen that I have received my first order of  @feastboxuk 🙌🏻
Firstly, I want to mention how impressed I am with how everything was packed! Plus everything is eco-friendly! 
If you don’t know what Feast Box is: a home delivery meal kit, providing a box of authentic and interesting ingredients and easy-to-cook recipes in your own kitchen. 
What I love about it it’s that there’s no waste! They send you just what you need! (In the cutest little pods! Go see my stories to check them out!) I love to prepare all the ingredients prior to cooking but that takes me so much time and I make such a mess 😅 so this way I have everything I need, the required quantities, all ready for me to start cooking. (Check my stories to see the spread)

The recipes are easy to follow! I chose this Durban Mutton Curry mainly because Durban is my husband’s home town and he always suggest I should find a better curry recipe. Well, I surprised him with this and he loooved it! It was proper curry, indeed!

They have so many other recipes, go check them out, the perfectly pre-portioned foods and spices are authentically Eastern, from the Far East, to the Sub Continent and the Middle East, with unique spice-blends and pastes to make cooking that much simpler. It’s so easy and affordable to try rare/unusual spices and ingredients! 🙌🏻 Use code 40FEAST to get 40% off your first order!  #cookwithoutlimits #ad #convenient #easyrecipe #homecooking #feastbox #discountcode",126,"['#mihaelabetsy\n#digitalinfluencers\n#contentcreators\n#bloggerlife\n#socialinfluencer\n#luxurylifestyleblogger\n#fashionbloggeruk \n#fbloggersuk\n#mihaelacooks\n#mihaelabakes\n#bbloggersuk\n#bblogger\n#foodvsco\n#foodandwine\n#foodglooby\n#foodblogfeed\n#beautifulcuisines\n#eatrealfood\n#kitchn\n#lifeandthyme\n#foodflatlay', 'Again this looks so good.

"Tuesday workout. 

Last night was really good for me. I managed to have an intense workout and managed to get my highest heart rate so far (170!!). Having a fitbit definitely makes me push myself. I often check my rate throughout to ensure I'm pushing hard enough.

I did 20 mins full body warm up

15 mins of @natorii_illidge. I would definitely recommend doing soca and HiIt exercises together as I found the impact particularly intense. I did however jumped so much I got a stich for the first time since school.

Folllewed up with another 10 minutes of zumba with @ysel_gh

Then to another @leanwithlilly session. 

I do think I can see my body changing (maybe a bit of tone). My fitness level and strength are definitely improving. I even used my 5k weights this time.

Outside out that I've started using  @goustocooking. Nice and good quality food but probably way more rice/pasta than I would ever normally eat. 

Excited to for my progress even more.

Loooved this king prawn arrabbiata last night 🔥 this one was super easy and tasted absolutely unreal. All we had to do was boil the sauce on a high heat and then put the pasta in, place in the oven for 25 mins and then add the prawns for an extra 5. The dish was the perfect spice level for me, we could have made it spicier as I only used half of the chilli flakes which is one of my favourite things about Gousto, everything can be made to your own spice level. I love cooking but 5 min prep ones are my fave to just bang in the over and get on with other things, especially in the week 🥰 I will deffo be making this one again!

"🥘 𝔾𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕠 𝕄𝕖𝕒𝕝𝕤 ⁣⁣( @goustocooking )
⁣⁣
Here’s some photos from last weeks mealsss, my first ever week of Gousto!! I chose; ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⭐️ Lean Beef Keema Naan ⁣⁣
⭐️ Chicken Goujons & Cheesy Beans⁣⁣
⭐️ Creamy Chicken Potato-Topped Pie ⁣⁣
⭐️ Bacon Cheeseburger, Garlic Butter Fries & Truffle Mayo ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The Beef Keema Naan was my ultimate favourite of the week, it was so simple, had so many flavours and tasted so good for only 566kcals!! Still, every single meal we have had both last week and this week, have been so tasty and enjoyed by all! ⁣⁣😋
⁣⁣
I can’t believe I’ve never tried Gousto before, there’s so many different options which change weekly(!!) and you get everything you need (give or take a few basic condiments like sugar, salt & pepper etc) and it’s all perfectly measured out to just add/cook when the instructions tell you to! My whole fam and in-laws have jumped on the hype now!! 🤣🤣 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Its the perfect option for anyone who wants help with new ideas of what to cook for tea, wants simpler and easier cooking when they get home from work or just want to save money and stop buying excess food from the supermarket, that gets wasted and eventually thrown away because this way, you’ll get and pay for exactly what you need for every meal you make!! - No waste! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
⁣⁣Home dining is the new takeaway / restaurant visit right??? 🥴 So I 100% recommend Gousto to those who haven’t tried it as I would definitely rank it as restaurant quality! (but maybe that’s just my cooking 😉😉) You can also opt out of the subscription or skip boxes whenever you feel the need, so you can literally subscribe for a week and leave, if that’s what you want to do!! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
AND lastly for those of you who want to try it out, my code ELLIE42168677 will get you 50% off your first box and 30% off the next 3 weeks after that! 🤗 ⁣⁣

"Salmon & Pak Choi With Coconut Rice
✨ 607 kcal per serving ✨
Such a light, but satisfying dinner. Loved @goustocooking coconut rice, as it is so easy to make but really works well with light fish dishes. As usual garnished with plenty of coriander and chilli 🌶 
 
Ingredients for 2 people

130g basmati rice
200g pak choi
220g skin-on salmon fillets
15g fresh root ginger
1 lime
1 red chilli
25g solid coconut cream
15ml tamari soy sauce 
10g coriander
80g sugar snap peas
1 garlic clove
 
Cooking instructions for 2 people
 
Add the basmati rice, chopped coconut cream and 250ml cold water to a pot with a matching lid and bring to the boil over a high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked. Once done, remove from the heat and leave covered until serving – this is your coconut rice
Meanwhile, slice pak choi in half lengthways. Finely chop garlic, ginger and coriander, slice 1/2 red chilli into rounds and finely chop the remaining red chilli.
Heat a large, wide-based pan with a matching lid, once hot, add the salmon, skin-side down, and cook for 2-3 min. Once the skin has browned, turn the salmon over and add the pak choi halves face-down and cook for 2-3 min until the pak choi has started to brown. Add the sugar snap peas, ginger, garlic and chopped chilli to the pan and cook for 1 min further until fragrant. Once fragrant, add the tamari soy sauce and juice of lime to the pan and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until the veg has softened and the salmon is cooked through.
Serve the salmon, pak choi and sugar snaps with the coconut rice to the side.
Pour over any excess marinade from the pan and garnish with the chilli and coriander. 
Enjoy!

"Gousto @goustocooking VS. Hello Fresh @hellofreshuk !!🍜

Officially jumped on the meal-kit bandwagon and wanted to do a quick overview of the two biggest platforms to give u all a better understanding of price/flavor/delivery etc. so you can decide which box to go for (if you are in the mood to spice up your dinners a little and make lockdown a little less dull))

💵 overall it was clear that Gousto is more expensive than Hello Fresh. This may be down to Gousto offering more meat choices in their delivery box or maybe the quality of ingredients that they send you (as we did notice a couple named brand products in the boxes)

🐟 Gousto offers customers a lot more meaty and fishy recipes compared to Hello Fresh and does not charge extra for those more premium meals, so if you fancy variety when it comes to your protein I would suggest you opt for Gousto

🤤 for us we tend to find some of Hello Fresh’s recipes were a miss in terms of flavor, these generally tended to be the simpler meals, however out of the six Gousto recipes we tried we could not fault any

⏱ Hello Fresh recipes were organized more easily, which helped and saved so much time when unpacking the ingredients as you could just throw all the bags in the fridge, Gousto’s wasn’t as easily organized and the ingredients were packaged in a few bags and then the majority were loose for each meal, which at times we found a bit confusing when navigating which ingredient matched which meal

Overall it just depends what you are looking for in a meal-kit service. Both boxes are equally as simple to recreate and have lots of different options whether you are looking for veggie meals, quick recipes or healthy staples. We absolutely loved trying both meal-kits and will alter between the two as we honestly cannot decide which we prefer !!

"⁣Week 6 - #fortheworld66 

Hey hey and Happy Hump Day 👋🏼

We are half way through that working week and the weekend couldn’t come any sooner 🤙🏼

So this week has been all about “Protecting our planet and it’s People” which, to begin with made me think ‘what could I do that not only works towards my personal goals but also fits in with this weeks challenge?’ 

Soooo, I decided to do something a little different as that’s what #gymshark66 is all about, right? @gymshark And got myself a @goustocooking box. 

There are two reasons for this;

Number 1 - Personal goals 📝

So, as mentioned in my previous posts, I’ve taken the time out to start managing my daily intake when it comes to those calories but my meals have become somewhat stale and lack variety so this was a great way of introducing different meals into my diet 💪🏼

Number 2 - Eco Friendly 🌍
 
I did a little research on this company and came to conclusion that not only do they provide you with these amazing recipes but they’re also as Eco Friendly as they come with fitted in nicely with this weeks challenge 💙

Very much looking forward to seeing how close I can get the meal to look as it does online 👍🏼. 

Challenge excepted 👊🏼

"Oven-Baked Cheesy Portobello Mushroom Risotto😋
@goustocooking 

So I wasn’t sure about this when we ordered it because I’ve never been a big fan of overly mushroom flavoured things. But I was so wrong! I loved every mouthful 🤤

I also think it’s great not to have meat in every meal, it’s not really necessary. And this still fitted into my macros for the day even though it was vegetarian 🙌🏼

So the mushroom risotto itself was great. Just a great standard flavourful risotto with a nice addition of leeks. But the portobello mushrooms!!!! They were actually something else!!! It was unreal how much flavour they had just from being stuffed with cheese 🧀

More please, 9.5/10✨

"10th February 2021...

Meals from last week!

Have you guessed yet that we absolutely love pasta in this house?! 😅🙈

Some of the dishes don't look like they have a lot on, but believe me, they were enough!

1st: Cheesy Cod & Spinach Gratin with Crispy Potatoes (Gousto)
Calories: 415

2nd: Chicken Kiev Pasta Bake with Lemony Courgette (Gousto)
Calories: 717

3rd: Bacon Cheeseburger, Garlic Butter Fries & Truffle Mayo (Gousto)
Calories: A-BLOODY-LOT!!!

4th: Herby Crispy Skin Chicken with Sticky Baked Veg (Hello Fresh)
Calories: 579

5th: Lamb Kofta Kebabs with Garlicky Naan and Zahtar Sweet Potato Fries (Hello Fresh)*
Calories: 878

*By no means was this my least favourite meal (we didn't have a least favourite this week to be honest...) but this dish could have done with some more lamb I thought!

6th: Chicken Pasta Bake with Courgette & Pepper (Hello Fresh) and Customized with added Bacon Lardons
Calories: 977

Yes, we had a lot of high calorie meals this week, but we're in a lockdown and enjoy our food way too much!

Favourites this week go to: both Pasta dishes and the Bacon Cheeseburger!

"Started our first ever @goustocooking journey last night and I reckon it was a roaring success!💪🏻

This harissa beef ragu with mint and feta mash really hit the spot and was ready in just under 40 minutes including all of the prep.😋

It can get a bit boring trying to find different dishes to cook during lockdown so this was a welcomed chance to try something we’d not normally pick or cook at home. We’ve a katsu curry tonight and I can’t wait to see how it turns out.

"DIY Pizza Margherita with Chilli Oil // Tortilla Wrap Pizza 🍕

Sadly not having pizza tonight for #nationalpizzaday but I did try my first Gousto pizza a couple of weeks ago so seemed like a good time to post that.

In all honesty, I think I messed it up. Followed the instructions exactly but the dough still ended up a little chewy and underdone sadly. We still ate them obviously. The topping was really nice - especially love some chilli oil on pizza. 

If anyone has any tips on how to make the base properly I'd love to know. As it was I'd give it 4/10 😣 and stick to my lazy / slightly healthier option of using tortilla wraps as a substitute for pizza bases. And if I want real pizza, I'll order from one of Edinburgh's many incredible takeaway options 😁",39,['#yesgousto #gousto #goustocooking #goustogang #goustorecipe #giveitsomegousto #homecooked #homecooking #foodie #instafood #foodblog #instascran #foodporn #veggie #vegetarian #veggiefood #vegetarianfood #fakeaway #pizza #tortillapizza'],gousto

Katsu chicken curry 👌🏼 I’ve never tried Katsu before and it was sooooo good!!! Bit of a pain in the arse to cook if I’m honest 🤣 the breadcrumbs were burning before the chicken was cooked 🙈 so I had to do a little SOS cookery and finish it in the oven rather than the pan 🙈 BUT when it was finished it was worth the hassle! The recipe itself was 521 calories, but this doesn’t include the flour I needed to add, so it works out at 661 calories in total. Delicious!! 👌🏼 #gousto #goustocooking #goustogang #goustorecipe #weightlossjourney #weightloss #weightlossdiary #weightlossblog #healthyfood #healthy #healthyrecipes #calories #caloriecounting #caloriedefecit #slimmingworlduk #slimmingworld #slimmingworldblog #sw #food #foodblog #recipe #ilovefood #whatieat #katsu",54,['This presentation 👏👏👏'],gousto
"10-Min Spiced Tofu Sofritas Bowl 🇪🇸
.
A really quick dinner. If you don't burn the first lot of spices that is 👀
.
Frying off spices with tomato paste, adding in the tofu and soy sauce, and mixing in pre-booked rice and kidney beans. And topping with fresh tomatoes and crispy onions... I do think that Crispy Onions make every meal better!

"Spanish Chicken Burger With Salsa Verde

Yes, I know.. Nothing like the picture on the recipe card!!

The chicken was very tasty considering the card called for only 4 seasoning ingredients.

Chips - perfect and the addition of the warm roasted peppers to the salad - tasty.

I added a little of the salsa Verde sauce to my salad leaves, of which I added, baby leaves and spinach and it transformed to salad totally. The salty - vinegary flavour. Yum!

Bulked out: Yes, added chicken breast, brioche buns as I had two in the freezer, 1 extra potato, some spinach and baby salad leaves.

Old score: 7 out 10 - it was good but don't think I'd make it again.

Lunch: simple jacket potato with tuna & sweetcorn and cheese (478 cals) 🧀
Dinner: @goustocooking garlic & honey pork noodles. This tasty, but they sent rice noodles instead of egg noodles so I think they would have been better - and the cucumber was a bit odd on the side (541 cals) 😂

We’re still on the Super Bowl hype 🏴‍☠️🏈 These vegan nachos were goooood. The burger part of the nachos was the famous @goustocooking vegan burgers all mashed up and fried so of course that was gonna be delicious. 🍔 The mustard ketchup mayo was really nice but we definitely could have done with more! The cornichons added a nice touch and really added to that classic cheese burger taste 🍔👌🏼. The only thing we weren’t super impressed with was the cheese. We love the @violife_foods cheese slices but on these nachos there wasn’t very much of it, and it didn’t melt well at all. We would have preferred some sort of nacho cheese sauce. 🧀✨

"Vietnamese-Style Spicy Beef Noodle Bowl😋
@goustocooking 

Okay wow this was AMAZING. We had this at the weekend and I’m still not over how delicious it was 🍲

I absolutely love noodles, have them multiple times a week, so when I saw this I had to have it because I love all the spices and ginger and lime flavours! 🌶

It was great that it was beef strips, worked so well! Also loved the pickled cucumber and I am OBSESSED with crispy onions so this was the perfect meal for me. Only thing I would change is the flavours could have been even more intense like more spice more garlic and more lime, but I loved it!!!🤤

Still dreaming about how delicious it was, 9.5/10✨

"= BOWL OF HEALTH 🍅🌽 Do you ever get the feeling when you crave a BIG FAT BOWL OF HEALTH? Just me? Fair enough. I don’t think I’ve eaten a decent salad since lockdown 2.0 whenever that was so that could be something to do with it. I basically have a love hate relationship with salads. I hate the fact that people think some wet leaves, tomato slices and sad cucumber slices can justify being a salad. No wonder they get such a bad rep. I love that fact there are so many wonderful colourful bits and bobs you can chuck into a bowl and make something genuinely scrumptious and ACTUALLY filling. That is exactly what his bowl of health is. A bloody brilliant colourful bowl of health, full of all the good bits and less of the boring bits. So colourful. Super tasty.

"Not a bad start to the week in work... I sat down and made some important decisions yesterday and feeling much calmer for it. Tonight I made charred plum with red quinoa + roasted veg with a pomegranate dressing 🌱 Another vegan recipe coming in at 490 cals 😊 Although this feed wouldn't suggest it, I have actually been eating meat lately (guilty takeaways) and comfort eating excessively 😂 But I've been working on being more patient and forgiving to myself, so hoping to work towards some improvements very soon!

"Soooo I may have missed out a couple of meals (I will update you on them separately in stories as they either aren’t worthy of a post or my photography was poor lol). But, don’t panic, here is the perri perri chicken with spicy rice and mayo lettuce. This has to be up there with the favourites. The other half and I were discussing over dinner today which meals have been our favourite and least favourite over this month (I’ll do a story on our final decisions when we finish our Gousto month tomorrow 🥺) I’m not gonna lie, but i really dislike spice. Like how can you enjoy food with that tingling feeling on your tongue? No thank you 😂 luckily, I was in charge of spice control and this meal wasn’t too bad. Despite the chicken taking long in the oven, the rest of the meal was really easy and quick to make.

"Yes... I need to get better at food photography.

Do I feel bad that i’ve gone full circle and started posting pictures of food on Instagram. Yes... Part of me thinks I should be banned from the internet. 

BUT... I think there’s an important lesson being learnt here. 

This is Tumeric Cod with Curried Lentils and Spinach, served with shaved pickled carrots... and it took me 10 mins! 

I’ve always enjoyed cooking but this is a whole new level for me, and I honestly feel stupid for how quick and simple it is. 

This specific dish tasted amazing - superb hit of flavour and the pickled carrot gave a great zing and freshness! I could have cooked the Cod a little gentler, but other than that, this is an absolute winner!

Go Big & Stay at Home is a beast 👹 I would say I'm a pro lockdown alcoholic. My First ever TIPA and wow, this knocked me for 6 even after smashing the amazing Venison burger from Gousto. I felt light headed 🥴
A big hoppy hit, that goes down surprisingly well, loads of flavour and loads of booze. What's not to like 🤷‍♂️

Definitely worth promoting Gousto food if you like it! 😊 Anyway, on to the slight let down that was today’s Chicken Katsu Curry. Thing is, we love katsu curry, and already have a great batch cook from scratch recipe. This was quicker, and tasted okay, but there were issues with the instructions that meant our breadcrumbs singed. There wasn’t enough katsu curry to soak into the rice enough for our taste.

This pizza is from goust's themed menu and yes we are a day late 😅 You really get so much variation with gousto. I don't think we ever ordered the same meal twice but we do remake a lot of the meals ourselves on the day we don't have a box.

"My HelloFresh has turned up today and I’m really looking to having these recipes this week. My box is a 3 meal 3 person, i have one meal from last weeks to use up still which is the risotto.
We have been having the boxes for a for a few weeks and they are great as you are supplied with everything except oil so there isn’t any food waste from them. You have about 30 ish recipes to choose from each week and there is lots of variety from fish, meat and veggie recipes. I love it as the meals have all the calories per portion listed on the recipe card.
If anyone is interested in trying a box i have a discount code that i can send which will give you £20.00 off your first box.

Im starting to replace some meat dishes with veg alternatives but making sure not to completely change the meal we originally really enjoy. 

I decided to try a food delivery service to help with the partial meat to veg transition. This way the exact ingredients are provided . This way I get to try dishes out without waste and over time, I can build the staple ingredients as I go , according to what we enjoyed. 

I was super super excited to Receive my first box with @hellofreshuk . 

I loved that each meal came in little packages, it was like Christmas checking it all off. We chose this meal as our first last night.

"I guess if you're a millennial trying to impress a date, this is what you buy to spend some quality time together.  You whip this stuff up (it took me like an hour to make this 35 minute meal) then spend the evening taking cute photos of it so you can tag #hellofresh and #hellofreshpics to give them some free advertising, preferably with a neon LIVE LAUGH LOVE wall hanging in soft focus in the background. The downside is, when you're done with the photo shoot, the grub is ice cold. Luckily, I realized my masterpiece was worthy of one quick snap, which I did and dug in. The food is great, but I was fooled: I thought they sent you a prepared meal, microwave ready. Nope. Too much work for me.

I love salmon. Seriously. It's one of the things I make on my own fairly often. So, I don't opt for it often with #HelloFresh - but I am so glad I did this week! The sauce was so good and the couscous was probably my favorite couscous that I've done with HF so far! I steamed the green beans, instead of roasting. I just like them better that way.

"Brand new (for me) Hellofresh recipe tonight--for dinner I made the Pimentón Pork Tenderloin with Bell Pepper-Potato Hash & Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce.  The hash made an amazing side dish—roasted bell pepper, onions & potatoes tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper & seasoning.  I need to find a way to organize my recipes because I would love to make the hash on its own 🫑🧅🥔 The tenderloin had a spice rub of paprika and garlic powder and it made a nice crust.

Anyway I'm posting less food pics, but I am still cooking though!😋 It’s because I’ve been doing this long enough now that my favorite recipes are starting to come up again in the menu rotation, so I've been revisiting ones that I liked.  It's fun, having staples to go back to, and seeing how much easier it is and how much better a cook I've become (I mean, look at how nicely I chopped those peppers and potatoes! I literally couldn’t even do that a year ago 😂)

My sister gave me a meal from her subscription, here are my thoughts...

Taste: great! I added some of my own spices however they provided enough to create a tasty dish, especially convenient for those that don’t have a pantry of ingredients to incorporate.

Skill level: I consider this easy ! Very quick as well which makes it ideal for those on the go.

Value: it was a portion for 4 but made 2.5 persons. I’m not sure what the price was, probably much more than this specific dish could be made for if you bought it yourself. However, convenience, freshness and skill level combined I can see how this is a fun service for either people with a chaotic schedule or who want to learn to cook.",2,[],hellofresh

"👅More nom noms!!

Tonight was a ‘cook what’s in the fridge’ meal. I’ve become minority obsessed with my air fryer, ESPECIALLY when cooking fish. It comes out perfect every damn time. 

🐟I love cod. Here’s why:

1️⃣ @therock loves cod and he’s THE MAN
2️⃣ A 3oz portion (think the size of a deck of cards) is only 90 calories, about has 1g of fat and 19g of protein!! 
3️⃣ It’s a lean and mean protein. However, it’s lack of fat disqualifies it’s ability to provide us the omega-3’s that we often hear fish consumption possesses. So, don’t overeat cod. We need fat to survive. 

🧂Seasoned with lemon pepper and panko for crunch

🥬Red lentil pasta by @barilla was win, and of course, my kale always wins bathed in Everything Bagel Seasoning. 

Today was a rest day besides my usual walk with Dori. As I always say, work hard, but recover harder🤘

Happy Monday!

When quarantine started (a year ago now) I was very pregnant & going food shopping just didn’t feel safe at the time. This was a huge dinner saver for us & made life that much easier. 

Now with an almost 10 month old this is a great dinner time saver! It’s great we can all come together as a family to help cook (my daughter is the veggie taster) to make a delicious meal that is proportioned out, & easy to follow directions. My number one tip for new moms or just housewives in general, this is a great way to have 2,4 or 5 nights out or the week already preplanned & proportioned out ready to cook. Again not a sponsor, I just really love the service!

Welcoming March with open arms. Hoping for better days ahead. Spring is definitely in the air.
I feel like there is so much to do this month with Ramadhan around the corner. 
Also hoping that March doesn't drag on for too long though as my husband is going away this month. Life always feels like it's on standstill when he is gone.

WHAT IS PIMENTON?
Smoked paprika, often called pimenton or smoked Spanish paprika, is made from peppers that are smoked and dried over oak fires. This process gives the red powder a rich, smoky flavor. The flavor is still sweet and cool without adding any heat to the dish, unless you purchase a hot, smoked variety.

"Dinner Last Night - Frank's red hot firehouse cheeseburger.

First of all, how is it MARCH already 🤯. Secondly, how are these burger recipes ending up as my most and least favorite?!?!

Well, Frank's redhot sauce I love, so no complaints there, but ranch is not the greatest imo, so their combination resulted in some mixed emotions! Shredded monterey jack cheese was difficult to put on top of the patty, and it didn't exactly melt and form a nice blanket on top of it 👎. Also, getting a bit tired of potato wedges by now. I think I need to start being a bit more discerning in my meal selections, there are plenty of choices every week, so shouldn't be too difficult hopefully.

So today is the first day on my new journey with @verityevansnutrition. The plan is to learn about macros and how I can eat a more balanced diet alongside my @fiit workouts (that I really enjoy) whilst still living my life and hopefully lose some inches along the way. 🤞🏻 I’m feeling excited albeit a bit nervous about not weighing myself for the rest of the month. #excited #focused #verityevansnutrition #nutrition #FIIT #myfitnesspal #journey #livinglife #caloriecounting #macros #caloriedeficit #hellofresh,21,['You absolutely smashed today. 🙌🔥'],hellofresh

Starting my new week and month with an yummy homemade burger. Very simple beef burger with Monterey Jack cheese and some ranch sauce on the buns and a sprinkle of fried onions. For the patty, I mixed ground beef with sriracha hot sauce and seasoning from @franksredhot 😋

We tried 3 meals for 2 people from Hello Fresh over the weekend and all 3 were absolutely delish! Swipe to see them all 😍 the tofu massaman curry was a particular fave soooo tasty! I'd definitely say if you're looking for some recipe inspiration or are short on time these are fab to try!

"Happy March! February went off the rails and I wasn’t really trying at all with making better choices. I weighed myself on Friday and I only gained half a pound since my last weigh in so not too bad but disappointed with myself as I could have 100% tried harder and could have ended the month with a loss but can’t take it back now. 
My anxiety was on fire in February so with Deacon back to nursery it’s time to get focused on myself and feeling good again ☺️ 
This month I’m trying calorie counting along with continuing my hello fresh orders each week and I hope this will give me a wee boost and a few more pounds lost before my birthday next month on the 2nd of April. I’ve got 4 weeks to feel as fabulous as possible for my 2nd birthday in lockdown 🥳 
I’ll probably be using this as a food diary mixed with anything else that takes my fancy so if amateur hour food pics are not your style, feel free to unfollow with no hard feelings. 

Let’s do this March 😊

✨Stir in 1 thinly sliced bok choy and 1 clove of garlic and cook for about a minute until soft
✨Pour in 100ml of teriyaki sauce (6.5 syns) along with 50ml of water and ensure everything is coated
✨Add 2 nests of cooked noodles to the teriyaki mixture and stir together, cooking for another 2 minutes until it's piping hot

Moroccan style lamb with Ras El Hanout, dill bulgur wheat and a courgette ribbon salad

I've seen a lot of @hellofreshuk meals on here lately so i thought i would give them a go to make cooking a little easier whilst my back gets better.

I love the fact that there is no waste, i also enjoyed not having to go to the supermarket! It was all well packaged and most importantly this meal was AMAZING. Full of flavour and ready in 20 minutes.

Think its pretty fair to say that I'm impressed 👌

"Aquafaba, aka chickpea water. Very grateful to my colleague Chef Manager @karlosm25 for introducing this to me as an egg substitute. Worked perfectly in these breakfast pancakes 🥞 added dollop of yogurt, jam and nut butter, as I took inspirations from @kuramiuk 
.
When does an ingredient become a food? I wouldn’t call aquafaba a food  but judging from the very limited number of resources available on their use, it’s probably not a very common ingredient either, even as chickpeas become quite popular these days.
.
If one of the eco-friendly solutions is to waste less food, shouldn’t we rethink what ‘edible’ means as consumers? In its entirety and not just the ‘good bits’ - when less is more and similar to our meat consumption, make what we have go further?

Kurami is part of a global conversation embracing the growing awareness that we need to change the way we eat, behave and live. By using heroic ingredients that are known to promote better all-round health or have specific benefits, they take the challenge out of knowing how to eat and live well. As part of a rewarding and mindful lifestyle, their dishes will leave you feeling energised, motivated and brimming with positivity.

Each daily box is packed with everything you need for breakfast, lunch and dinner alongside snacks and drinks to keep you full throughout the day. Each meal day has been carefully crafted by our dedicated Nutritionist, who has selected each dish to create an enticing and balanced menu for you! Kurami works at home, at work or on the go - fitting seamlessly into the busiest lives. 

They have sourced the finest ingredients, collaborated with a fantastic nutritionist, hired the best chef and counted the calories of all their food and drink. 

At the core of Kurami is an understanding of the vital importance of gut health and how taking care of your second brain can leave you feeling beautiful and looking fabulous. Science suggests that good gut health promotes improved digestion, and lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes. 

What's all this got to do with skin? You can read about the connection between the gut and skin here on the blog post I did with nutritionist @georginechikchi via my website.

"#SundaySkin Following on from my IG LIVE earlier in the week with Nutritionist @georginechikchi I thought I would touch on why I really like the concept of @kuramiuk.

I find the concept of #Kurami particularly compelling because the aim is to treasure and nourish your body through one of its basic needs, food! Kurami recognises the importance of gut health and the impact it has on organ systems, including the skin. 

Beauty is a concept I personally struggle with, because it is so abstract and personal. What is beautiful to one person may not be to another, and it is usually based on external factors. 

Kurami is attempting to attain ‘beauty from within’, this is a message that I find relatable and would like more people to adopt. I know that internal health can affect the exterior, so I advocate building a strong foundation through diet, exercise and lifestyle.

Tips on how improving your relationship with food can help improve both your mind and skin: 
👉 Having a healthy, well balanced diet can have positive impacts on the skin barrier via the gut.
👉 Taking a proactive approach to meal management and incorporating nourishing foods into your
diet can be a good way to improve general health and mental wellbeing.
👉 Modifying the gut microbiome (e.g. through pro/pre/syn-biotic supplementation) may have a
role in the prevention and management of skin disease.

"I take pride in my work-particularly my work as a medical referral expert in the UK. I am very careful and picky with the clinics, consultants and medical companies I chose to work with. 

Kurami is a concept I have definitely been looking for in London that provides healthy and organic food. I was happy to also find out that they  could arrange organic halal meat for me. Health is wealth and you are what you eat.

This company definitely travels extra miles to keep you all happy. In the IGTV @cami_pgar has covered the frequently asked questions. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. 

Thank you @busi.london for the space and beautiful ambiance.

"@simplycookcom Pad Thai. This was lovely, although I thought it wasn’t quite as tasty as some of the other SimplyCook meals. However, it was very quick and easy to make so perfect for a mid week meal-fairly healthy too. We did add a courgette for extra veg. 
If you’d like to try SimplyCook you can get a box of 4 of their kits for just £1 using the code (my mums code) in my bio. Definitely worth a try for that price & easy to cancel after 1st box if not for you!

11p rice (boil in bag pack of 8, 89p)
£1 2 breaded chicken breasts

- Cook onion in a pan and cover for 5 minutes to soften
- Stir in the ‘katsu paste’ and coconut milk, bring to the boil and reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes
- Add 1 teaspoon of ‘gochujang paste’ to the sauce and mix in, cook for 2 more minutes.

"Every other week there's just me and Freddie for dinner, so I started looking for food ideas. Simply Cook provides the herb and spice mix, and rubs etc for lots of delicious sounding dishes.
So much cheaper than buying a food box that contains that veg that no one eats. I was throwing stuff away which really doesn't sit well with me, as well as all of the boxes, bags, airbag packing, frozen packing...
Four flavour packs to go with recipes that look easy to prepare. All I have to do is buy the main ingredients, and the list for each recipe is very small (these meals are for two). I can work out what to swap to make these SW friendly. If I don't like what veg and meat they suggest, I can swap it. And if I don't use it this week, I can use it next week. No waste. Brilliant 😊

"Thai Chicken Curry from a recipe by simply cook.  I added mangetout and yellow peppers which weren't in the recipe.  Very tasty, quick especially on a work day.

"Another classic, quick and delicious @simplycookcom recipe I had in the cupboard. Gunpowder potatoes are my absolute fave and after having them at Mowgli when we were allowed to go out (lol miss you summer) I knew I needed a quick recipe for at home. Plus you can never go wrong with Kebabs! 🥔 Slide to see the step by step recipe and ingredients! ENJOY ♥️
