116,"What does animal-free dairy protein taste like? 

Nothing! It doesn't have a flavor. 🤯 

Our animal-free dairy protein is specifically an animal-free whey protein isolate. Pure whey protein isolate (no matter how it's made) is as neutral a flavor as you can get. Pea, soy, and other plant-based protein isolates tend to have a strong taste that needs extra ingredients to mask. 

Fats and sugars are responsible for dairy products' flavor, while the dairy protein provides the structure. The protein is how milk and cream can transform into everything from your morning latte to cream cheese to mozzarella. We provide partners our animal-free dairy protein to then craft delicious, indulgent dairy products that are just as tasty as good for the planet. 

Contains: milk protein.",".

24,"For this colorful dish 🧡💚I was inspired by a few different posts I’d saved but couldn’t make a complicated  sauce since I wanted something super simple and quick with whatever ingredients I had. 

Features 
Koginut squash from @samascottorchards 
Cabbage from @norwichmeadowsfarm 
Onion from @centralvalleyfarm 
Blue oyster Mushrooms from @smallhold 
Broccoli raab from @4thstreetfoodcoop 

Here’s what I did.
1. Boiled the bean pasta (only likes like 3 mins much shorter than regular pasta) and started to steam the cubed koginut squash over the boiling pasta
2. Sautéed onions and garlic in olive oil.
3. Drained pasta and started sort of steaming/ low boiling the squash in the same pot with a half inch of water
4. Added chopped mushrooms to garlic and onion.
5. Added slivered cabbage and raab a few minutes later.
6. Stirred together sauce: 
I think I used 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp maple syrup, 2 tsp hot sauce, 2 tbsp vinegar, 4 tsp starch (tapioca), 2-4 tbsp sesame seeds and some water. (Not my idea, borrowed from a few recipes!) 
7. Add sliced tempeh to the pan.
8. Once veggies and tempeh are cooked, turn down heat and stir in the sauce and noodles and squash.","#buylocal #shoplocal #localproduce #knowyourfarmer  #seasonalfoods #farmersmarket

This includes:
💜Eating lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods make up a healthy diet. Some of my fave ways to get in fruits and veggies are to make nice cream from frozen bananas and to blend up smoothies. 😋

♥️ Getting in more movement. I’ve recently been recovering from a back injury, but in normal times you’ll find me walking and doing yoga and Pilates. 🧘‍♀️ 

❤️ Spending time with loved ones. A less-stressed life is good for your heart! I just took a break to chat with my hubby, and cuddling my kitties also reduces my stress levels. 😻

11,"🧼💦🌎 Thanks to that virus that shall not be named, I’m washing my hands like crazy! One day while washing my hands with whatever store-bought soap was on sale at the time, I realized I wanted to be more responsible with my soap buying choices. So I found these cute little pump lids that attach to a standard size mason jar (which I have a million of because I thought how fun would it be to make mason jar candles? It’s not fun. It’s super hard. I managed to produce one candle and decided it’s not for me🤣) and then it was on to the soap. I wanted to find a company that was natural, environmentally responsible, ethically sourced, cruelty free, and gentle on my poor finicky skin. Hello @drbronner 💙 This company ticks all my boxes and then some! When I read their story I fell in love. In addition to their commitment to the environment, the way they support all these different important causes is incredible and something you don’t see often. This statement really struck something in me, “To heal, make whole, become one, these are all one and the same. For people suffering from PTSD, depression, addiction and end-of-life anxiety, it means holding all that we are, light and shadow, blessings and pain, and bearing it with patience, acceptance and love until it is transformed and we become whole again.” I have received some pretty significant blows in my life and have struggled with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I am lucky to have a strong support system in my family and friends and access to a great doctor and therapist, but I know others do not. Dr. Bronner’s will now and forever be special to me for supporting this community. I can’t say enough good things about this company. Be Kind ♥️🙏🪴💫🧿 #canada #yeg #wholefood #plantbased #vegan #organic #vegetarian #flexitarian #nutfree #glutenfree #nongmo #foodismedicine #allergies #microbiome #sustainability #reducereuserecycle #drbronners #ethical #fairtrade #natural #gogreen #healsoul #allone #mentalhealth #notanadjustafan"

22,"Butternut squash with bacon and creme fraiche - normally a favourite but after my 3rd Veganuary and 2 meat free January's before that  I'm finding it less appealing to  eat meat again this year.

But it's still hard  to work out the practicalities when the rest of the family still want to eat it and are getting more and more resistant to my efforts to reduce, suddenly deciding they don't like some vegetable based meals they have previously eaten quite happily - just for the sake of being stubborn as far as I can tell.

22,"Burnt Onion and Eggplant Pasta 🍝 

Ingredients: 
2 onions
3 eggplants
Bulb of garlic
Dried mint/mint
Lemon juice
Tahini 
Ground cumin, sweet smoked paprika powder
Cherry tomatoes
2 red peppers

Method: 
Heat the oven to 200 °C and get out a large baking tray. Drizzle oil onto a baking sheet on the tray. Chop and quarter the onions, cut the top off of a bulb of garlic, and cut the eggplant lengthways. Use a knife to cut a cross-hatched pattern into the fleshy part of the eggplant, and dip into the oil on the tray. Make sure the onions are also covered on the pan. Lastly, cover the bulb of garlic with aluminium foil and add onto the tray. Check on it after 40 minutes, add a cup of water onto the onions, and turn the onions if necessary. Add the chopped peppers and cherry tomatoes and bake all for 20 more minutes.
Meanwhile make the sauce: Combine 2 tbsp tahini, 3 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp cumin, 3 tsp pepper powder, 2 tsp mint. 
Once the tray vegetables are baked and burnt, take the tray out of the oven and let cool. Transfer the onions to a bowl that you can use with a stick blender. Then, scrape out the fleshy parts of the eggplants with a spoon and add to the bowl. Don’t mind if any of the outer bits get added accidentally. You can also squeeze the skins above the bowl to get all of the flesh out. Lastly, squeeze the caramelised onions into the bowl, and add the tahini mixture. 
Mix together with a spoon and then blitz everything together until smooth and silky. Season to taste - feel free to add additional smoked paprika if necessary. Add to a pan of cooked and drained pasta, along with the roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes. Top with freshly cut parsley!

54,"Fish Friday!  Quick, easy and with a collection of seasonal vegetables rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients.  Little ones will love this too, as the base vegetables are soft and the fish can be flaked once cooked.  You can use any white fish fillets and it can easily be prepared for one or for a large family.
.
White fish contains lean, high quality protein along with good levels of selenium, the antioxidant mineral required for immune health and well researched for its impact on DNA repair. 
.
This is per person
* Butter or olive oil
* 1 white fish fillet 
* 1 medium potato, diced
* 1/2 large carrot, cut into batons
* 1/2 celery stick per person, sliced
* 1 garlic clove, chopped
* a few sprigs of thyme
* 2-3 spears purple sprouting broccoli
* 100ml white wine
.
* Put the potatoes in a pan of boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes.
* In a pan, melt a knob of butter or a tbsp of olive oil and gently cook the carrots, celery, garlic and thyme for about 5 mins.
* Drain the potatoes and add them to the carrot pan.  Mix well to coat with the oil or butter.  Add a little more if the mixture is too dry.
* In a mixing bowl, spray the purple sprouting broccoli with olive oil and massage the spears to make sure they are evenly coated. This prevents burning.
* Place the mixture in a roasting pan and then nestle the fish fillets in-between. Season and add some more sprigs of thyme and a little butter or olive oil to the surface of the fillets.
* Pour the wine into the pan, cover and seal with foil and cook at 180 for 15 minutes.

5,"let’s talk about SKIN✨ I have had various skin issues over the years. Lookin at you, Adult Acne🖕People who I’m hoping karma has a plan for affectionately call me Pizza Face 🙃 I had tried everything you can think of. Prescriptions, Antibiotics, ProActiv, and literally everything in the drug store. The funny thing is, as soon as I stopped putting everything under the sun on my face and let it be, my face cleared up. I still have the occasional cystic acne pop up, but I can almost always link it to what I’ve been eating or if I’ve been extra stressed lately. I will share my secret weapon for those pop ups another time. My hands though, they can’t seem to find what they like. I’ve tried every sensitive skin lotion and all it does is set my hands on fire. If I leave them be, they crack and bleed. And don’t get me started on Covid-19 and 20 hand washes a day and repeated sanitizing - I’m surprised my hands haven’t just fallen off at this point! This brings me to the lotion in my photos: BroccoFusion by Newco. Trust me. Look up all the benefits of broccoli, it’s crazy. This lotion is the ONLY THING that calms my skin. I am also acutely aware that the root of all of this is likely inflammation somewhere in my body. Changing my diet has already made a huge difference in my appearance, my mood and my energy levels. I am excited for every new day in this little life of mine 🤗 Be Kind ♥️🙏🪴💫🧿 #canada #yeg #wholefood #plantbased #vegan #organic #vegetarian #flexitarian #nutfree #soyfree #canolafree #glutenfree #dairyfree #allergies #acne #excema #foodismedicine #sustainability #crueltyfree #bpafree #minimalism #motherearth #broccoli #newconaturaltechnology #broccofusion #notanadjustafan"

109,"Big Buns burgers and fries 🍔🍟

A super exciting new venture for @falafelguysuk that allllll the Leeds foodies have been posting about is @bigbunsuk! They launched last week and we had to get in on the action since we’ve always enjoyed their food and it’s lovely to see new places opening during all this. 

As we don’t eat beef we opted for their veggie options and got the Falafel Guys OG Vegetarian, the Frenchie Vegetarian and some of their sharing fries with cheese sauce. 

The burger patties were falafel and went nicely with the toppings and sauces, they really hit the spot. I have to say though... the chips were something else. So so crispy and salty, plus they’re curved and I don’t know why but it makes them so much better. 

Check them out if you’re in the Leeds area and are looking for somewhere new to try this weekend. Their smash burgers look unreal and I’m hoping they might add a chicken burger 🤞🏼

*full disclosure, this meal was paid for by us, but as part a soft launch promo we got the burgers thrown in for free and only ended up paying for the chips and our drinks 👍🏼",Honestly the best burger Ive had delivered in Leeds 🤤 and you're so right about the chips!,Omg need a burger now 😍,The fries 😍😭,That’s a pretty perfect looking burger right there!

I've been making a lot of soups lately, surprising even myself. This time it's a quick and great vegan ramen: a piece of fresh ginger (minced), a shallot (diced), a carrot (julienned), half of a bell pepper (diced), two heads of bok choy (cut into quarters), a block of tofu (cut into cubes), two pieces of white radish (diced), some scallion, a little bit of oyster mushroom, approximately two tbsp of miso paste, and about 125g of chow mein noodles. And some spices like salt and black pepper. I basically just dumped everything but the noodles into boiling water, waited a few minutes for the veggies to soften, then added the chow mein. Also sprinkled over some sesame seeds before eating.🌿🍜

12,"STEWP IDEA OF THE WEEK
You just can't beat hot crispy potatoes!  So I like to make these for the Patatas Bravas. Here is what I do. To time with eating the cooked Stewp, start this 30 minutes before the Stewp is ready.
1. Put 2 tbsp vegetable oil into a roasting pan and heat the oven 
to 180C.
2. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2 cm chunks. I prefer to use Maris Piper for oven roasting as they get really crispy, but any floury potato will work.
3. Boil the potatoes on the hob for 5 minutes then drain.
4. Add the potatoes to the oven dish and turn to coat in the oil.  Keep them separated if you can. Roast for 20 minutes.
Enjoy!

36,"Warm up with this Spicy Buffalo Chickpea Stew recipe.⁠ 🌱
⁠
I’ve heard lots of people wanting tips on how to eat healthy while working from home and I am working on a post to share with you! But in the meantime - if you have healthy food, that is prepped and tastes great on hand.....well you’re more inclined to eat well. 
⁠
I shared this recipe last fall it was such a hit I wanted to share it again for new friends and as a reminder for everyone else. ⁠
⁠
Buffalo Chickpea Stew⁠ 🌱
⁠
Ingredients⁠
⁠
1 tablespoon avocado oil⁠
2-4 cloves garlic, minced⁠
½ yellow onion, diced⁠
2 stalks celery, diced⁠
2 medium carrots, peeled & chopped⁠
½ red pepper diced⁠
1 ½ cups cauliflower, finely chopped⁠
1 can chickpeas (or 2 cups cooked chickpeas) ⁠
1 (28oz.) can diced tomatoes⁠
4 cups vegetable broth⁠
¼-1/2 cup Buffalo Franks Hot Sauce⁠
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast ⁠
2 tablespoons ranch seasoning⁠
½ teaspoon onion powder⁠
⁠
Directions⁠
⁠
1.  In a large pot over medium heat add oil, garlic and onion and cook 1-2 minutes stirring frequently. ⁠
⁠
2.  Add in celery, carrots, red pepper and cauliflower and cook another 4-5 minutes stirring often to avoid sticking. ⁠
⁠
3. Add in chickpeas, diced tomatoes, broth, buffalo sauce, ranch seasoning, nutritional yeast, and onion powder and simmer on medium to low heat for around 20 minute until vegetables are cooked. Top with vegan sour cream or fresh cilantro. I love to toss cilantro on everything because it add a ton of flavour and it also helps to remove heavy metals from your body. ⁠
⁠
Recipe note if you wanted to make this a family meal you could lighten up the buffalo sauce and puree soup with handheld immersion blender or food processor. My kids love tomato sauce but hate chunks so by blending it up they get all the veggies with no complaining. You could also sub chickpeas for chicken or add rice, barley or noodles. ⁠
⁠
If you want to make this a creamier soup add in 1/2 soaked cashews pureed with 1/2 cup broth. ⁠
⁠
I hope you enjoy this warming, comforting soup recipe!⁠
