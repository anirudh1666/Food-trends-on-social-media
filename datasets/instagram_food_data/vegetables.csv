11,"Raspberry & Avocado Salad With Sweet Dressing 😋 

My fave salad is definitely an avo one. This dressing is the best as its nice and sweet but balanced with the pomegranate juice. 
You can add anything additional to the salad such as cucumbers, peppers, croutons etc. But this is a simple version.

Ingredients:

•	2 Avocados (skin removed and chopped into small chunks 
•	Around 100g raspberry's (or as many as you like)
•	6 Baby gem lettuce leaves (washed and dried)
•	5 cherry tomatoes (Washed and cut in half)

Dressing:

•	½ cup olive oil
•	1 ½ tbs agave
•	2 tbs Pomegranate 
•	1 tbs fresh lemon juice
•	1 tsp wholegrain mustard
•	Sesame seeds
•	Dash of salt and Pepper

Method

1.	Lay down your baby gems and pop over the rest of the ingredients 
2.	Drizzle with dressing & serve immediately 

Hope you enjoyed this quick salad recipe. 🥗

4,"Edamame has all the right to be called a “Super Food ”! ⠀
Simply put, edamame are the whole or immature soybeans. The mature soy beans take up a brownish colour, whereas the edamame are green. This fresh vegetable soybean seed has 35% protein and about 5% healthy fats making it a highly nutritious snack. Some studies also suggests that edamame contains 60% more calcium, and twice the potassium than green peas. ⠀
⠀
Edamame beans add texture and give a protein boost to salads. It is also loved for its sweet nutty flavour. You can find them in our  Vegan Tofu, edamame & cucumbers salad , or Duck, edamame & cabbage salad!⠀

3,"Simple changes can make big differences, starting with what you eat - eating more wholegrains, more fruit, and less sodium, which means less salt can all help reduce the risk of premature death and disability.

So how much should we be eating?

- There is currently no advice on what amount of wholegrains to eat in the UK but many experts in other countries say to aim for three servings a day (BDA)

- Evidence shows there are significant health benefits to getting at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. That's 5 portions of fruit and veg in total, not 5 portions of each (NHS)

- Adults should consume no more than 6g of salt a day (2.4g sodium) – that's around 1 teaspoon (NHS)

The Steamtown shrimp rice plenty of small prawns were there but I felt nice to be a bit undercooked

Boneless fried Chicken and cashew nuts was good. It was not spicy And it had its own vegetables. 

Steamed vegetables had a variety of vegetables which was unique, crunchy 

Loved the fact that they used lots of black mushroom and seaweed

FUN FACT 👉 👩‍💻 

Wheat is the staple crop of Northern China, and you will find an abundance of wheat-flour products in the form of noodles, dumplings, steamed buns, stuffed buns, and pancakes. Rice is also eaten in the north, but is definitely secondary to wheat

#nofilter ☺🌱☺🌱☺🌱☺

Good morning🙈
Today, I had this delicious plate for breakfast☺ It has been the first time I made this dish and I love it!!! 
For the scrambled Tofu I squeezed to water out of the tofu (100g). Then, I cut an red onion (20g) which I fried in a pan. I usually do not use oil, because I do not really notice a difference, but you can use oil if you want to. When the onion is brown, shred the tofu with your hands and add it to the onion. Add some spices (I used curry, curcuma, salt, pepper and nutmeg). After 3 minutes, add 20g soy yoghurt to the tofu mix and heat it up for 2 more minutes. Thats it! Enjoy it☺

1) Measure out 10gms (Can increase later if needed) of palm jaggery/karupatti and lightly warm it with fresh pressed coocnut milk. Do not boil. The jaggery must be crushed and heated on low flame until it melts. Use this recipe as needed, initially daily and then you could taper it out as the amount of breastmilk increases⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

2) Roast 2-3 tsps bajra flour in 1-2 tsps ghee, after about 20-30 seconds, slowly add milk continously stirring without lumps. Add jaggery⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

HOW TO STAY FULLER FOR LONGER!
⠀
1️⃣SOUP
Both healthy choices. However, choosing the Broccoli & Cheddar soup🥦🧀 will be more filling as it is HIGHER in fat and is more calories. Eating healthy fats in your meal or a serving on the side (like nuts or cheese) will help you stay satiated🙏🏻
⠀

2️⃣SALADS
Salads should be filling! Some lettuce leaves and a few cubes or cucumber isn’t going to get you anywhere🥒😕 Fill your salad with Good protein and fats - and use those non-starchy veggies to add VOLUME 🙌🏼

A lot of times, carbs by themselves aren’t very filling🧐 They give us a quick sugar boost (even with natural, healthier sugars like fruits) - but we’re hungry again VERY shortly after!⌛️ Add protein & fats to your snacks can help keep us FULLER for LONGER ⏲ Try adding string cheese 🧀, yogurt or skyr 🥣, or nuts 🥜 to your snacks & see if that makes a difference :)
⠀
⠀
4️⃣BREAKFAST
Pair your protein🍳 with additional filling foods like fat 🥑 and non-starchy veggies (for VOLUME) to keep you full all morning long!☀️
⠀
⠀
5️⃣SMOOTHIES
RESEARCH shows 👩🏻‍🔬🔬that eating, or chewing food is more filling & satisfying than drinking! So eating your food will help you stay fuller for longer - instead of blending those same foods into a smoothie!🥤
⠀
Hope you find these ideas useful!

13,"Superfood Smoothie..
What do you put in your smoothies?
The good things with making your own smoothies you can add any fruit or vegetables you like, 
All your benefits in just one smoothie drink, 
I am adding coconut water because it has several nutrients and antioxidants so is a good source too add in your smoothie. 
Dates have at least 6 different vitamins ,
spinach, apples, cucumbers have again so many benefits,  vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate, magnesium, iron and vitamin B2 
Chia seeds contain large amounts of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of high-quality proteins and antioxidants so a little off this too. 
So get blending your fruit and vegetables too make a delicious smoothie too help keep you nice and healthy.

Ingredients ..
3 dates chopped 
Cup off spinach 
One red apple thinly sliced
One green apple thinly sliced
1/2 cucumber peeled and cut into small pieces 
300 ml coconut water 
1/2 Tbs Chai seeds 

Method ..
Place all ingredients in a high speed blender or @nutribullet and blend for around 60 seconds until you get a smooth and creamy texture, 
If it feels too thick add a little more coconut water, 
Taste your smoothie and if all ok pour into your glass and serve immediately,
Enjoy 😊

.
Follow us @veganfood_hub for more vegan recipe ideas 💚🌱
. 
.
📋Ingredients:
3 Tbsps extra virgin olive oil
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste about 1/4 teaspoon each 
1 lb. Persian cucumbers (or seedless cucumbers)
4 green onions
1 bunch Italian parsley 
1 lb. fresh ripe red tomatoes, mostly seeded

Instructions:

In a small glass bowl, whisk your olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt and pepper; set aside.

Gently scrub your vegetables then thoroughly rinse under cold running water. 
Slice cucumber in half lengthwise then dice into cubes as shown.

Chop your green onions and dice the tomatoes. I discarded most of the tomato seeds for this salad.

Remove most stems from parsley, then chop the leaves.

In a large salad bowl, gently combine diced cucumber, onions, tomatoes and parsley.

Drizzle your prepared dressing over the veggies and gently toss until evenly coated.

Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Enjoy! ❤Rachel !!

49,"Japanese Cutlet Curry(#豬排咖哩飯；#カツカレー)

When I was in Japan I loved this dish! The curry has a wonderful sweetness and the pork's outside is curnchy with the inside being very juicy😋😋.

For the curry I just used vegetables (carrot, leek, oyster mushrooms, onion, just any vegetables in my fridge).
I used butter to fry all vegetables first, added the water and  brought it to the boil and cooked until they became soft. Then add the @sbfoods.official golden curry, use a low heat to let it cook for while. Then add the dark soy sauce. It gives a deep flavour and nice colour.

I baked the cutlet rather than frying. Firstly I marinated with sake, soy sauce, a pinch of sugar and cornflour. Then cover with pankon (or you can add pinch of salt then cover with flour, beat egg then cover with pankon), put it into the oven 200/220 degrees for 30 minutes. 
I really recommend frying the pankon with a little oil first to give it a nice colour.

What is your favourite curry?

109,"This recipe of Torai ki sabzi is very popular in our otherwise meat-loving home.

It’s a simple recipe which can be cooked every once in a while to break the monotony of non-veg food.

You will find the video tutorial in the highlight under the name “Meatless Meals”.

Here’s what you need:

1 kg torai, peeled and cut into cubes
1/2 cup cooking oil
1/2 tbs ginger garlic paste 
1 tbs red chilli powder 
1 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 tsp turmeric powder 
3-4 medium tomatoes, chopped
5-6 green chillies 
10-12 curry leaves 
Ginger for garnish

Method:
Heat oil in a pan and add your cut up torai to it. Add ginger garlic paste, red chilli powder, salt and turmeric powder and give it a good mix. Then add chopped tomatoes, chopped green chilies, and curry leaves. Give it a good mix again for about a minute, then cover the lid and on a very low flame let it cook for 15-20 minutes. Bhuno after 20 minutes for about 8-10 minutes. Garnish and serve!

This is my mum’s recipe. Do try it and say a little prayer for her if you like it 💕

Did you know that our chef @stephaudet had a blossoming career in Canada before moving to Lisboa. ✈️☀️

Executive chef of multiple restaurants, founding member of the women's chef association, a published cook book under the belt and a long track record in consultation and education.

Starting over with a blank page can be scary sometimes, but also exciting and life changing.

Without taking risks, you never know what you can achieve. 

After taking the leap, she is happy as can be with her new life and career. Let's hope she can get back in the kitchen as soon as possible.

6,"I received a call yesterday from one of my most fervent cooking class participants. Even though it has been almost a year since I have conducted in person classes, when it came time for her to send thank you gifts to dear friends she thought of my cookbooks and asked if I would send out 3 sets. “Of course”, was my answer to which she followed with, “when is your next book coming out.” It has been 5 years and I have started many, and obviously finished none. BUT the wheels are spinning and these are some illustrations done by my incredibly talented partner and husband that serve as my inspiration will be gracing the pages. For those of you familiar with me and the Optimal Kitchen, I don’t think anyone will be surprised that the protagonist of my next book will be the all all mighty fruit and vegetable kingdom. May I remind everyone that fruits and vegetables are where we get all of our vitamins and minerals. And if you want to argue about the importance of nutrients in animal protein like beef, might I remind you that cow gets all the nutrients it needs to thrive from the grass. Plants give us everything we need, everything else is treat. #goodhealthstartswithgoodfood #eatlocal #eatyourveggies #eathealthy #eatclean #plantbased #plantbasedmeals #plantbaseddiet #fueledbynature #fuelyourbodyright #plantpowered #vegetables #fruit #eattherainbow",Go Heather!

Today I saved food from the garbage can again. Since I never know what is in the bag, I always open it curiously. Today I'm more than happy, because I loooove broccoli and lettuce. But of course I'm also happy about the rest - especially because the delicious vegetables are not thrown away.

I love ramen noodles. Add some miso broth, fresh veg and prawns and it's perfect.

This is so quick, easy and healthy. You don't even need to cook your veggies, although I did in this instance.

You can add any combination of veggies(cooked or raw), meats, broths, toppings. The possibilities are endless. 

The Recipe:
Make your miso broth, I added a an extra dash of light soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and siracha sauce to mine, place your noodles in it and cook them as per the instructions.

Meanwhile, if you want to cook your veg, heat a little vegetable oil and toasted sesame oil in a pan and add finely sliced garlic and ginger and cook it on a low heat. Don't let it burn. Add your veggies and cook them just enough to keep the crunch. I kept everything separate so I can arrange it nicely. Sprinkle the garlic and ginger over. I left the shredded carrots and spring onions raw. 

Place you're noodles in a bowl and pour in the broth. Arrange your veggies.

For the prawns (or other meat) Optional: In the same frying pan, or a separate one, heat a little oil and cook the prawns on a medium heat. Add soy sauce and some black pepper and cook them off. Add to the noodle bowl.

Sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds, fresh cut spring onions and eat!",Yummy minus the 🍤😬😬😬🤩,That looks great 🌟Please check out our profile 🔝🙌,What a lush ramen bowl 😍,So many yummy flavours,#ramen #ramennoodles #noodles #japanese #misosoup #miso #vegetables #prawns #japanesefood #foodphotography #foodporn #foodie #instafood #igfood #foodpost #foodblogger #foodpic #foodiegram #foodgram #foodgasm #food52 #food #foodstagram #instagood #tasty #foodiesofinstagram #soulfood #healthy #healthyfood #eeeeeats

By washing in filtered water, you’ll be able to reduce contamination that would otherwise come from the chlorine, fluoride, and other chemicals in our drinking water. With cleaner fruits and vegetables, you’ll be able to enjoy them both raw and cooked, without worry. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

22,"My day summed up ✨

I was so interested to see how my eating habits looked on a plate.

It's so easy to post things and represent how you 'want' your day to look, but I often have people messaging me, asking how I maintain the 'daily slog' of pointing and counting. Usually making reference to healthy eating and the upkeep of low calorie, fullfilling meals. 

I'll be honest, it's hard.

So I thought instead of posting one-by-one meals, I'd post my full day - yesterday I went on a 5k run (walked some because I'm a beginner to the sport) but I pushed myself! And so my body needed fuel. I had 3 substantial meals, all filing and healthily prepared, whilst still appealing to the eye! I didn't snack at all this day, nor did I feel the need to! - FYI snacking is okay, and sometimes you need it. I just felt satisfied with the food I'd eaten...

Look after the body that looks after you! ✨
