"Is there a problem pasta can’t solve? We don’t think so. 
We added wild mushrooms and a bunch of fresh thyme for this January blues antidote. 
Ingredients (serves 4):
400g mixed mushrooms (we used a mix of oyster, shiitake, portobello and enoki) 
2 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp salt 
30g fresh thyme, leaves picked 
50g white wine 
350g fresh pasta or store-bought
1 tbsp vegan butter 
Method: 
Start by prepping your mushrooms. Avoid washing them as they’ll absorb water and become soggy. Instead, use a damp towel to clean any dirt off. After they’re clean, slice them up.  Heat your olive oil in a heavy sat pan over medium heat, and add your prepped mushrooms. Let them cook, untouched (important, don’t move them!), for 6-7 minutes, until the heat facing side is golden. At this point stir them around lightly, and let them continue cooking untouched. At this point, add the salt, fresh thyme and white wine, and let cook for 2-3 minutes, until the wine has reduced. Set aside while you cook your pasta in boiling salted water. When the pasta is cooked, reserve about ½ cup of cooking water and set it aside. Drain your pasta, and transfer it to your cooked mushrooms. Turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir in the reserved cooking water and tbsp of butter in until the pasta is glossy. Taste for salt and adjust to taste. Serve topped with extra fresh thyme and black pepper.",540,"['#pasta #veganpasta #allplants #recipe #italianfood #mushrooms #thyme #herbs #cooking #chefs #vegansofldn #veganfoodshare #vegansofig #januaryblues #plants #eatgreen #plantbased', ""Looks and sounds absolutely delicious 🍄🥣🍄 I always thought fresh pasta wasn't vegan and have been using dried as I believe that is?"", 'That looks delicious!\nTempted to order but interested in what packaging the meals come in?

"You don’t need chicken soup for the soul. You need THIS game changer. 
Jam-packed with kale, rice and crispy garlic, it’s healthy, hearty and delicious. 
Ingredients:
2 + 1 tbsp olive oil, separated 
1 white onion, finely diced
400g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
1 tsp salt
180g white rice (preferably short grain) 
1 litre vegetable stock
200g kale 
250g oyster or king oyster mushrooms (to top) torn apart
10g dill

For garlic oil (makes ⅓ cup):
6 cloves garlic
⅓ cup olive oil 
Method:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced white onion and sauté for 6-8 minutes, until translucent. Add the sliced mushrooms and let cook, untouched, for 8-10 minutes (this helps them develop bite, texture and flavour, before the stock is added!). Add salt, stir and continue cooking for another couple minutes. Add the white rice, followed by the vegetable stock. Simmer for 25-30 minutes, until the rice is cooked. Remove the soup from heat and stir in the kale. 
While the soup simmers, prepare the mushroom ‘chicken’ chunks. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pan, add the oyster mushrooms and let cook untouched (yes, again) for 6-8 minutes, until the heat facing side is golden brown. Turn them around, and continue to let cook untouched, for 3-4 more minutes. Season with a sprinkle of sea salt and remove from heat. 
Serve the soup topped with oyster mushrooms, fresh dill and garlic oil (recipe below). To make the garlic oil, add oil and garlic to a small sauce pan. Simmer the garlic, stirring often, until golden. Transfer both the oil and garlic to a bowl and let cool. Store in a jar at room temperature, and use it to top soups, salads, veg and pasta!",399,"['#veganchickensoup #allplants #veganuary #vegansofig #veganfoodshare #veganrecipe #veganuary #healthy\xa0#healthyeating #teamgamechangers #gamechangers', 'This looks like a yummy and healthy and easy soup for us @nickfostermusic', 'Sounds and looks delish 😍😍', 'Oh wow this looks amazing 😍', 'Just cooked this for lunch.

Who doesn’t love breakfast food for dinners! Always somehow more delicious. 😁🥰🍓 A bowl of organic oatmeal, blueberry cashew yogurt (freaking yum by the way), ground flax seeds for my Omega 3’s, and a bunch of other necessary nutrients, and some blueberries, blackberries and strawberries for my dose of anthocyanins {found in deeply-colored fruits and veggies} whose compounds activate anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-cancer pathways. ✨✨✨
.
Back to the vegan yogurt for a second. Good vegan yogurts were nearly impossible to find until cashew milk.**angles singing** Cashew cheeses, ice creams and yogurts are by far the most superior way to dairy-supplement. There’s a killer brand called Forager I’ve discovered at Whole Foods, then saw Trader Joe’s had a cashew yogurt too and decided to give it a try. Excellent!! Both have that cultured, yogurty taste and nice consistency. Pick some up next time you’re out!

"Omega 3 and why it’s important. *Important*
The Omega family of fats are special in the body as they need to be eaten in food and cannot be produced from other fats.

There are 2 types of Omega’s– omega 3 + omega 6. These oils are used structurally in the body in cell membranes as well as in hormone regulation, bone health and much more. Omega 6’s are found in seeds, nuts and vegetable oils such as sunflower, rapeseed etc. They are necessary for health, but in excess can become inflammatory. Examples of Omega 6 fats are linoleic and arachidonic acid.

Omega 3 fats are anti-inflammatory. In plants (eg flax  hemp) the form we eat is ALA (Alpha linolenic acid) and in oily fish + wild meats it is EPA and DHA. In fact, brain tissue is 60% fat (dry weight), mostly DHA. 
DHA + EPA are the forms that humans require and we must convert ALA through a number of stages to become DHA or EPA. This is not a straightforward process for us. 
Problem 1. Whilst milled flax seeds and flaxseed oil can raise ALA, research shows that they do not go on to increase DHA and EPA significantly. Some research suggests that conversion is well below 10%. This means that flaxseed oil and it’s supplements may not be enough to support nervous and brain tissue.

Problem 2.  A large number of people have a genetic variation that means they have a higher requirement for omega 3’s. PUFA gene. 
Solution? Honestly, tricky. I have measured a lot of people on plant based/ vegetarian diets for their omega 3 to omega 6 ratio and the results show that this is not as easy to resolve, especially as people on a plant base diets are eating lots of nuts and seeds, which are  high in Omega 6 which push up the ratio. 
There are 3 solutions:
1.  It is essential to take an Algal Omega 3 as this form seems to be far better utilised in the body than flax as it is in the DHA form! This is a must! 
2.  Some people may still choose to still take a fish oil or cod-liver oil to prevent deficiency and keep the omega 3 to omega 6 in a healthy range. 
3. Use olive, avocado +coconut when cooking. Avoid processed food as they can contain too much vegetable oil. Use flax oil in salads, but not as a supplement.",37,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma', 'Great post, knowing about Omega 3 is so important!', 'Omega 3 changes everything!

"Bread and butter. Name a more iconic duo. 
Maybe our vegan bread and butter pudding with your favourite plant-based custard? Or ice cream? Or both? 
Full recipe below! Want more great recipes like this? Check back in with us tomorrow for something extra sweet…
Ingredients (Serves 6-8):
Base 
10 thick slices quality day-old bread 
3 tbsp plant-based butter 
2 tsp cinnamon
2 tbsp sugar 
½ tsp salt 
150g dark grapes (the smaller the better)
½ cup flaked almonds, to top
2 tbsp maple syrup, to top
Custard:
800ml plant-based milk 
5 tbsp brown sugar or maple syrup 
1 vanilla pod, scraped 
1 tsp cinnamon
½ tsp cardamom
¼ tsp nutmeg 
2 tbsp arrowroot 
¼ tsp salt 
Method:
Preheat your oven to 180˚C.
Start by making the base. Spread the butter evenly onto the 10 slices of bread. In a small bowl, combine cinnamon and sugar together and mix. Spread the mixture evenly onto the buttered bread. Cut the coated slices of bread in 2-inch chunks, and transfer to a deep baking dish. Scatter the grapes evenly over the bread, tucking some in between bread chunks. 
To make the custard, combine milk, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg in a saucepan and simmer until it reaches a simmer. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, then whisk in the arrowroot and salt. Pour the custard over the bread base and top with flaked almonds. Let the bread pudding sit for 20 minutes to soak, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and grapes are bursting. Remove the pudding from the oven and brush with maple syrup while it’s still warm. Let cool for 10 minutes before tucking in.",246,"['#vegwithedge #allplants #breadandbutter #blueberries #vegan #vegansofig #veganuary #healthy #fortheplanet #foryourhealth #teamgamechangers #gamechangers', 'I cannot wait to make this!', 'Oh my word my favourite pud plasticised - will make this asap']",allplants

With an on the go lifestyle, I've been enjoying the @allplants meals, as it is as simple as popping it in the microwave to heat and eat a tasty, nutritious and vegan meal. 🥬

"Red risotto. A warming hearty bowl of creaminess!
Ingredients to serve 2:
30g vegan spread (flora buttery is great)
150g arborio rice.
1 tbsp olive oil.
1 red pepper.
200g button mushrooms.
1 white wine stock pot dissolved in 500ml boiled water.
270g (half a bottle) Cirio sieved tomatoes.
1 tbsp yeast flakes.
1 tbsp minced or powdered garlic.
1 tbsp onion powder.
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce (more if you like it really spicy!)
Salt and black pepper.
Fresh parsley or rocket leaves.
Vegan alternative to hard cheese, or any other vegan cheese will do.
Method:
Chop the pepper into small squares, slice the mushrooms.
Melt the spread in a saucepan, heat the olive oil in a frying pan.
Add the rice to the melted spread and stir with a wooden spoon, heat gently for a minute.
Add the pepper to the frying pan and fry on a medium heat for a few minutes.
Begin to add the stock to the rice, a bit at a time, keep stirring and don’t let dry out. Heat gently.
Add the mushrooms to the frying pan and cook through. Turn off the heat when done.
Continue to add the stock to the rice as required. When half the stock is used, begin to add the sieved tomato juice, a bit at a time, keep stirring.
Stir in the yeast flakes, garlic, onion, salt and pepper (to taste) and sriracha sauce.
Continue to add the tomato juice until used up, continue to stir as the rice will tend to stick to the pan, then add the rest of the stock a bit at a time to keep the rice moist but not waterlogged.
Test the rice now again to check when it’s cooked through, once it is, add the pepper and mushrooms. Keep stirring!
Add more sriracha sauce, salt and pepper if required.
Reduce the liquidity until you have a creamy consistency.
Serve into bowls, top with chopped parsley leave or rocket and grated cheese alternative. Follow me for more delicious vegan recipes!#veganrecipes #nomeat #nodairy #nocruelty #veganuary2020 #allplants #allgood #savetheplanet",10,[],allplants

"Hi 2020! We've started off Veganuary with a bang💥 by partnering up with @allplants, the coolest plant-based meal service (and people!) around 🌿. Our lucky hands have been some of the first to work at their awesome new site and are loving it ✅
Give their challenge of going plant-based for two days a week a go: allplants.com/challenge 💯
.
.
#veganuary #allplants #plantpower #hirehand",20,[],allplants
"For the next 2 days I'm taking part in the @allplants ""2 days. All plants. Every week"" challenge #gifted
.
I believe that eating more plants is good for your health and the health of the planet.
.
Why 2 days every week? All Plants have calculated that after a year, with every Brit taking part, we would have reduced the carbon equivalent of taking 54% of cars off the road or planting 1.1 billion trees!
.
On the whole, people like to think in black and white, so it's easier to do 2 whole days plantbased than think about including 6 plantbased meals + snacks in a week! But of course you can be flexible if that works better for you.
.
Who are @allplants? They're a meal delivery service that provides delicious and nutrient packed frozen ready meals straight to your door, made with,  you guessed it - ALL PLANTS.
.
I think it's a great option for if you're busy and don't have time to cook from scratch, if you're intimidated by making plantbased versions of your favourite foods (e.g., lasagne or shepherd's pie), or if you just want an easy way to include more plants in your diet.
.
This morning I started with my usual smoothie bowl (this one was a salted caramel berry bowl) for lunch I will be having an all plants meal. Check out my stories to see what I choose 😁

"I’m in the 3rd week of the ‘ALL PLANTS. 2 DAYS. EVERY WEEK’ 🌱 January Challenge with @allplants and here are my thoughts so far! [gifted]👇🏼.
.
- Meat free meals are actually really bloody delicious and not boring at all. Anyone who says so are simply eating the wrong things!
- The less I eat meat, the less interested I am about it (I’m also doing meat free lunches for the rest of the week too).
- Veggies rock.
- My diet has become a lot more varied!
- I’ve noticed a difference when it comes to my gut health 👏🏼 (less bloating, better digestion, increased energy, etc).
- Falafels are my weakness 🤤 Just stuff them in a wrap and I’m all yours.
- I’ve now found myself ordering more vegan based meals when I’m out and I love that. 1) because they’re often packed with more veggies and 2) falafels.
- Since the beginning of the challenge, I’ve been educating myself more about the planet and have started making little changes elsewhere too 🤓.
- I 100% will be continuing this challenge for as long as I can into the new year 💛.
.
Has anyone else taken up a challenge for the new year? Are you trying to eat less meat or go completely plant based? Would love to hear below! 🌍.

"DOUBLE TAP if you love meals in bowls!
✨

Sometimes a meal can be as easy as making a perfect bowl!
✨

1) Add a whole grain of choice: quinoa, brown rice, millet, buckwheat, amaranth
✨

2). Add a plant protein: beans/lentils, tempeh, tofu, mock meat ✨

3) Add tons of veggies (I would have put in even more if I hadn't been taking a picture)
✨

4) Add a sauce (preferably one with a good fat such as avocado or cashews)

Note: quinoa isn’t technically a grain. Also, all plants have protein!!

"Turn up your veg game with our sweet turnip and red onion bake. Given it a go? Let us know 🌱 #vegwithedge

Ingredients:
2 large turnips, cut into 2 inch x 1 inch wedges
1 tbsp + 2 tbsp olive oil (separated)
½ tsp + ½ tsp salt (separated)
3 red onions, sliced
2 apples, sliced
3 sprigs fresh thyme
2 tsp grainy mustard
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp maple syrup
Herby breadcrumb topping:
50g breadcrumbs
½ tsp thyme
1 tsp dried rosemary

Method:
Preheat your oven to 180˚C. Spread the sliced turnips on a large baking dish and drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and salt. Roast for 15 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven, add the sliced red onions, apples and thyme, toss to combine and roast for another 25-30 minutes, until the turnips are soft and the red onions are starting to brown.

In the meantime, make the dressing by combining 2 tbsp olive oil with the mustard, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup and remaining salt. 
To make the crunchy topping, spread the bread crumbs onto small baking dish and toss with thyme and dried rosemary. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden.
Drizzle the dressing onto the roasted vegetables, and sprinkle with the herby breadcrumbs.",279,['#vegwithedge #allplants #beetroot #orange #pistachio #vegan #vegansofig #veganuary #salad #healthy #fortheplanet #foryourhealth #teamgamechangers #gamechangers'],allplants
"Testing a recipe I developed for a plant based version of the seekh kebab. It worked remarkably well; meat alternative (I used beyond meat) marinated overnight in ginger, garlic, green chillies, onion, turmeric, cumin, garam masala and salt. Formed into a patty and pan fried for some colour then finished in the oven to cook through. The texture was pretty good, it was nice and juicy and the flavour was spot on! .
.
Then I got hungry, so I packed it into pitta, along with some lightly dressed salad, a drizzle of yoghurt (yes, not vegan, I know! ☺️) and some of my homemade fermented chilli sauce. It really was delicious! .

"*NEW RECIPE* Pumpkin Seed ‘Green’ Milk 
Today I have been making nut-milks. Please listen to my nut milk video or read my post on this topic first. 
Nut milks taste great, but the amount of actual ‘nut’ in commercial brands is on the low side. 
Making your own is so easy and more nutritious.

NOTE: You can use any nuts of seeds to make your milk: cashew nuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, Brazil nuts, coconut, macademia – the list is endless. Tag me your creations!

Pumpkin Seed ‘Green’ Milk
Pumpkin seeds are rich in iron and zinc and calcium.

Ingredients:
·  100g Pumpkin seeds soaked overnight in filtered water
·  500ml filtered water
·  2 dates, optional to sweeten

Method
1.  Soak the seeds overnight in filtered water

2.  The next day, drain and rinse them and pop them in a food processor, such as a Bullet type blender, Thermomix or a Vitamix

3.  Add 2 dates to sweeten naturally or omit for unsweetened milk

4.  Blend on high power for 1-2 minutes until smooth

5.  Either store and drink straight away, or use as a base to smoothies, with porridge or in shakes OR

6.  Strain using a muslin bag or nut bag (you can buy these from amazon). If doing this squeeze all the liquid out of the bag.

7.  Use the remaining strained ground nuts in your cooking. 
Add to soups, stews or to homemade bread or crackers. Don’t throw though as it is full of nutrients. 
TIP: I prefer mine thick so I don’t strain mine – it is all personal taste. 😋",38,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #', 'The pumpkin seed milk looks amazing!

"Which plant –based milk should I choose?

Most pre-packaged dairy free milks are quite low in overall nutrients. This means that they only contribute a little towards our nutritional requirements for calcium, vitamins D and A or protein. 
However, they are a very tasty convenience and work well as a base for shakes and smoothies and for use in cooking. 
Here is a nutritionist run-down on the plant milks available.

Nut Milks. There are a huge variety of nut milks on the market, however the actual nut content is often miserably low (often just 2%). Making your own nut milk is by far a more nutritious, especially if you do not strain them. 
The food industry often adds rice and various vegetable oils to processed milks. This means that most of the ‘energy’ found in the Milks is derived from fats and carbohydrates and they contain very little overall protein.

Some plant-milks contain added calcium and vitamin D to make them nutritionally similar to dairy, however most do not. This is an important point as supplementation may be required  as a top-up. 
Please see my second DAIRY post on this to find alternative sources of calcium, vitamins D, B2 and B12 as well as iodine and vitamin A. 
Nutty Nutrition Facts
Cashews- iron
Almonds- magnesium, manganese, vitamin E, calcium 
Pistachio- potassium, iron
Coconut- potassium, copper
Brazil nuts- selenium
Sunflower seeds- zinc, iron, folate
Pumpkin seeds- calcium, zinc, iron

Soya Milk - is probably the most similar to cow’s milk from a protein and nutrient perspective, however it is not recommended that we consume soya milk in large quantities. A splash here and there should be ok, but it is wise to take all other soya products you are eating into account such as yogurt, miso and tofu to make sure that you are not having too much. Around 50g average per day of soya products may be an acceptable amount. 
Oat milks are higher in carbohydrates and might contain some beta-glucans. Many are vitamin and mineral fortified. 
Or make your own-recipe with nuts, sunflower or pumpkin seeds- who says milks have to be white🤣Don’t strain them if you don’t have too. Just shake it them for added nutrients.

Got a new sweatshirt that I plan on wearing every cozy, cozy day for the rest of the winter. Anti Dairy Social Club. 
Hate to make this controversial (in actuality idgaf. You rarely hear me preaching about something I care deeply about - my veganism.) #unpopularopinionahead Dairy is even more sinister than meat (I abhor both). With meat, the torture ends. With dairy, the animal is overextended, overexerted, and taken advantage of to its limits. No living thing should be at the disposal of our selfish desires.
I predict I have a really cozy, cozy winter ahead. That, and, you know... sleeping well at night knowing nothing is being tortured and abused for my own satisfaction. 🤍🐄🖤

"For the benefit of those embarking on Veganuary, it is important to understand which nutrients we are trying to replace when we omit dairy from our diet. The main nutrients in milk, yogurt and cheese are: protein, vitamins A and D as well as Riboflavin (B2), B12, calcium and iodine.  So what should you eat instead? - Calcium-  Tofu (calcium is used to help ‘set’ the curd) and sesame seeds are a great start. Please use unpolished sesame, not white, as much of the calcium is hiding under the outer layer. Seeds such as sunflower and nuts such as almonds and cashew, beans, dried figs, vegetables such as watercress, kale, seaweed, rocket, okra and even quinoa all contain calcium. 
Making your own nut milks, adding beans to stews, seeds and nuts to meals, tahini to dressings and eating some occasional tofu will all help you meet your daily requirements. -Vitamin D, unless you live in a climate that offers sufficient sunlight, this is a nutrient that mostly needs to be supplemented in plant based diets. Vitamin D helps us absorb calcium from our food and is necessary for calcium homeostasis. It is important to check blood levels to ensure adequate supplementation and to prevent over-supplementation. -Vitamin A – most people can convert beta-carotene and other carotenoids into vitamin A, however some people are genetically better at this than others,  thanks to variations to the BC01 gene. Beta-carotene is the orange colour in fruits and vegetables. Even green vegetables contain levels of carotenoids, but they are just masked by stronger hues. Carrots, pumpkins, bell peppers, butternut squash, sweet potatoes and oranges are contain carotenoids.

Protein can be found from a wide variety of foods, such as; pulses, seeds, nuts, quinoa, tofu and wholegrains. 
B12 may need to be supplemented- nutritional yeast and marmite. -B2 is also in found in Marmite, quinoa, avocado and nuts. -Iodine is found in seaweed- seaweed crisps are great! 
The important take-away is that there is not one food to replace dairy, but instead the importance should be on eating as many different foods as possible on a plant based diet and ensuring that every mouthful counts.",21,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #stijntestrake', 'Thanks Dominique for helping to confirm that a plant based diet is actually FULL of all the nutritional needs we require!

"VEGANUARY- Let’s Talk MILK. Part 1

Moving to a plant based diet involves giving up milk, cheese and yogurt. This can be difficult for people as it is so entrenched in the western diet. 
It may also be slightly addictive! This may be a trick of nature to make us drink well as babies, but there have been scientific links made to the casomorphines (opioids) that are produced when we digest milk. It is thought that these opioids could be behind a pleasure response when we consume dairy making it harder to give up. 
There are mixed views in the nutrition world about the benefits and negative effects of milk. I remain neutral and just give the science as it stands. In clinic I work very much with personalised nutrition. This means that my recommendations are specific to an individuals health status. 
However, milk does contain a number of growth hormones to help a calf develop and grow faster and may contain elevated levels of hormones. Both of these may not be beneficial to adult humans. 
It is also recognised in the health world, that all dairy is not created equal. Whilst well fermented dairy in the form of kefir, yogurt and some cheeses can offer tolerant individuals nutrition benefits, we are also seeing an increase in people’s sensitivity to the milk protein, casein in both allergies and intolerances,  as well as a sensitivity to the milk sugar lactose which can lead to bloating, gas and diarrhoea.

Dairy may also trigger an inflammatory response in some people, especially those with certain autoimmune conditions and possibly in some cases with eczema or acne. 
The smaller A2 casein proteins found in goat milk may cause less of an inflammatory response according to recent research. 
Milk is of course a good source of calcium, and if it is full fat vitamins A and D. In fact, full fat dairy is one of our main food sources of vitamin D in the UK.

Calcium is however also found in green leafy veg, legumes, unhulled sesame seeds, nuts, seeds and tofu. Some dairy milks are also fortifIed with calcium and vitamin D, so it worth reading the label. 
Vitamin D may need to be supplemented, but it should be possible to meet calcium needs when going plant based.",20,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #', 'Photo credit Heather Barnes Upsplash', 'Dairy free is definitely best...']",allplants

"Mama Drew’s Bangin’ Bolognese! My all time Classico, I’ve been making bolognese since I could reach the kitchen counter! I may have invented it in a previous life 😆 It’s another one of my favourite versatile recipes because it can be changed up with additional ingredients. I always cook up a big batch and freeze as required. The quantities below feed at least 6.
For this you will need:
Olive oil, enough to well coat the frying pan or wok you’re using.
1 white onion (or red if you prefer) diced
2 sticks of celery, diced.
200g button mushrooms, use brown ones for extra vitamin D.
454-500g vegan mince - I use Tesco frozen soya mince, but this does contain wheat.
540g crushed tomatoes (I use Cirio)
400g chopped tomatoes.
2 tbsp tomato purée
1 garlic bulb (to taste)
salt and black pepper.
30g of fresh basil, stalks removed.
Dried oregano (to taste.)
Dried parsley (to taste.)
A glug of red wine, add as required.
For an extra kick - dried chilliest.
For extra creaminess - vegan cream.
Method:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok.
Add the onion and celery and soften for a minute or two on a medium heat.
Stir the ingredients repeatedly as you add them.
Add the mushrooms, heat gently until they begin to release their water.
Add the mince and cook for 5 minutes. If you have a lid, put it on to retain the moisture.
Add the crushed tomato juice, chopped tomatoes and tomato puree.
Continue to stir all the ingredients together.
Add the garlic, basil, salt, pepper, parsley, oregano and red wine, plus any additional ingredients suggested above.
Stir and keep on a low heat, don’t allow to dry out, add water if required or put the lid back on the pan/wok. Cook for 5 mins, then taste. Add more herbs and spices as required to your taste. Continue stirring on a low heat, add the lid to avoid becoming too dry, or leave off if the ragu is to watery.
Cook 75g of spaghetti or pasta of your choice according to the packet instructions (about 10 mins)
Serve with mixed olives, chilli flakes or grated Coolidge Parmesan style cheese. Enjoy! #vegan #plantbased #allplants #nomeat #nodairy #nocruelty #savetheanimals #savetheplanet #saveyourself #sharingincaring #veganrecipes #veganuary",14,[],allplants

"Vitamin D, the sunshine ☀️ vitamin is present in very few foods naturally. It is only found naturally in animal foods. Sources include the fats in milk and dairy as well as oily fish, egg yolks and liver. 
This may explain why levels of Vitamin D are often lower in vegetarians and vegans than in omnivores. NHS England recommends supplementation of vitamin D3 irrespective of people‘s dietary preferences as sub-optimal levels are common. They suggest and adult dose of 10mcg or 400ius daily.

Sunlight, is still the most effective way to reach our recommended daily amounts of vitamin D as we can manufacture it under our skin. But blood levels tend to fall between the months of October and March. 
In northern Europe, it is virtually impossible to obtain sufficient vitamin D through our skin during winter months as the rays are too weak. Lying in the sun, in mid-summer in swimwear could allow us to make between 10,000-20,000IUs vitamin D in around 20-30 minutes, depending on the research source. But in winter we mostly only present our hands and face to the elements making this much harder to achieve. 
Vitamin D is not only essential for calcium homeostasis and bone density, but also for our immunity. Some research has linked vitamin D levels to reduced susceptibility to infections such as colds and flu and has also linked it to reducing inflammation in the body. 
Vitamin D is also important for the health of the gut lining as it helps regulate the tight junctions between the cells lining the small intestine. Those on plant based diets may need increased monitoring of blood vitamin D levels to identify the correct supplementation levels are achieved. Below 50ng/L is considered too low and around 50-70 optimal.

Some health conditions may benefit from higher intake of vitamin D, particularly some autoimmune conditions and osteoporosis.

If supplementing, Vitamin D should be taken in the D3 form, as this seems to be more effective and better utilised than the D2 form. It is important to speak to a nutrition professional if you want to take larger doses longer term as with all fat soluble vitamins, they can be stored in the body and too much can lead to toxicity.",26,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #', 'Photo Karen Cantú Q']",allplants
"Beet the bland with Joey and Val’s tasty take on a comforting salad. 
Roasted beetroot, oranges and a crumbly pistachio crumb make for the perfect way to kick off 2020 resolutions. Here’s what you need (to serve 6):
500g raw beets
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
½ tsp salt
3 oranges, sliced/segmented
Pistachios, toasted

Method:
Preheat your oven to 190˚C. Wrap the beets in foil, place on a baking tray and roast for 50-55 minutes, until you can insert a knife into the largest beet. While the beets cook, toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan over medium heat, for 1-2 minutes, until they’re fragrant.

Transfer to a bowl, and toss with olive oil, red wine vinegar and salt. Remove from oven and let cool, covered in their foil, for 15 minutes (the steam will help remove the skins easily). Unwrap the beets and using your hands or a knife, remove the skins of the beets - they should easily slip off.

Cut your beets in quarters and transfer to the bowl with the spices and oil. Toss gently to coat all of the beetroot in the dressing.

Segment the oranges into the bowl with beets, and if you have any juice remaining from slicing your oranges, add it to the bowl. Serve topped with a sprinkle of sea salt and toasted pistachios.",264,"['#vegwithedge #allplants #beetroot #orange #pistachio #vegan #vegansofig #veganuary #salad #healthy #fortheplanet #foryourhealth #teamgamechangers #gamechangers', '@tracyaubrey  bit of you']",allplants

"Vitamin B12 is mostly absent from the plant-based food chain and most people on a vegan diet will need to supplement this vitamin.

Although it is possible to get B12 from plant foods such as seaweed, fermented soy, spirulina and nutritional yeast, plant foods actually contain forms of B12, known as B12 analogues or cobamides. Some research has suggested that these plant forms of B12 could actually reduce the absorption and utilisation of active B12 in the body and could potentially increase the need to true B12. 
B12 is a real all-rounder in the body. It works in synergy with the other B vitamins and is vital for methylation which is probably the most common chemical reaction that takes place in our bodies. Estimates lie at over a billion methylation reactions every second. 🤩 B12 is necessary for energy production, liver detoxification, oestrogen metabolism, DNA (our genetic material) production and repair, switching genes ON and OFF, neurotransmitter production and helping to reduce homocysteine and histamine levels in the body.
.
Lack of B12 may lead to tiredness, nerve damage, infertility, mental health problems, heart-disease and pregnancy complications if left untreated. B12 deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anaemia, where the red blood cells become enlarged. This makes it more difficult for them to travel along narrow capillaries to deliver their oxygen. Since B12 is necessary for the production of cellular energy in the body, this may be why tiredness is probably the most cited symptom in those with deficiency. 
The current RDA for B12 is around 2.4mcg daily, but since we do not absorb all of this in a tablet form supplementation levels are usually higher.

B12 is considered to mostly be a safe vitamin to take, but methylated forms of B12 (methylcobalamin) tend to be more active in the body. This means that they are usually taken in lower doses than cyanocobalamin supplements. 
The Vegan Society UK currently recommends:
-Eating foods fortified foods with B12, 2-3 times a day OR
- taking a 10mcg supplement daily - OR -taking a weekly B12 supplement of 2000mcg 
Check with a nutrition professional if in doubt.

"Trying out some new food/recipe subscription boxes this year. Starting with All Plant which delivers all vegan fully cooked frozen meals. The reason I decide to try them is the fact that every single thing in their box is recyclable. I kept finding me and my husband eating crappy food on the evenings that we didn’t want to cook or had nothing in our fridge. So having healthy meals in the freezer is the perfect solution. I was also looking to eating more vegetarian/vegan dishes this year to cut on our meat consumption. Plus our baby girl has quite few allergies and this is the kind of food that we will be able to share from our plate. 
I have started with two meals a week for two people so it requires some space in the freezer since the delivery is every three weeks as per my choosing. Besides that the only thing left is to taste the food and if it tastes as good as everything else seems to me then I will definitely be sticking to the subscription.

"Do beans make you bloaty or give you IBS?

This can be a bit of a challenge on a plant based diet as people tend to rely in beans and lentils for their amazing protein content. 
But many people find that they cannot tolerate pulses in their diets and that consuming them increases symptoms of bloating, gas, reflux, pain, distension, diarrhoea or constipation. There is, as ever, a scientific reason for this.

Beans, whether cannellini, navy, kidney, chickpeas, black-eye or evening red and green lentils contain oligosaccharides, in particular fructans. These are members of the FODMAP food family which are well-known for causing symptoms in susceptible people. 
Oligosaccharides are poorly-digested carbohydrates that may not be broken down quickly enough in the small intestine, leaving them available as a food-source to the trillions of gut bacteria waiting patiently for their next energy supply. This fermentation can bring about many of the symptoms mentioned above.

The pulses with the lowest oligosaccharide content are red lentils and chickpeas. According to scientists at Monash University (who first detailed and outlined the FODMAP diet) oligosaccharides are water soluble and can leach in to the cooking water during cooking. By discarding and rinsing the pulses, after cooking, the amount of oligosaccharides present can be reduced. This means that it may not be possible to throw-in a handful of lentils to a soup or stew, but instead you may need to have a ready cooked batch of pulses in the fridge or freezer. 
Canned beans (well rinsed) also have slightly lower oligosaccharide levels.
Tips:
- If using dried legumes, these may be more problematic. -Soak all pulses (even lentils) well overnight and then rinse them thoroughly before cooking. -Discard cooking water after cooking and rinse thoroughly. -Ensure adequate cooking time for beans. Lentils will cook faster.
- Consider using tinned beans and ready cooked or pouched lentils. - Sprouted legumes have Lower oligosaccharide levels as do fresh pods such as Edamame
- Reduce portion size if necessary until manageable
- Choose red lentils and chickpeas first
- Keep bags of frozen beans in your fridge or freezer",87,"['#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #', 'So interesting and so important to know', 'Great info 🙏🏼', 'Full of anti-nutrients', 'This is the most informative post I’ve seen in ages.

"Let’s talk about Thieves! Did you know that Thieves oil goes back in the time of the Plague in the 1400s?! Authorities noticed that Thieves were stealing items for the homes of the dead. This puzzled them because everybody that came in contact with someone with the plague died. They couldn’t figure out how these Thieves were staying alive after being exposed to the plague. Once caught, the magistrate offered the Thieves leniency if they would explain how they were able to avoid contacting this deadly disease. It turns out that the Thieves were perfumers and spice traders who knew what to use to avoid getting the disease. Hence the name “ Thieves “ was born. Thieves oil is made up of Clove, Cinnamon, Eucalyptus, Lemon, and Rosemary.

"Why does everyone get so uptight about protein?  We hear about the Gorilla being a vegetarian and do think ‘What’s the problem?’ But we also need to remember that a Gorilla eats healthy food most of the day and isn’t tempted by bread, biscuits, granola, vegan meat alternatives and chocolate!

If protein intake is low, carbs are normally high. While some fill up with sweet potatoes, quinoa and dark sourdough breads, there are others who fill up on cereal, white rice, bread, pasta, toast, sugary drinks as well as snacks or crisps. This means that we tip the balance in favour of simple carbs which can upset our energy levels, blood sugars and also our natural hormone balance – PMS anyone?

Adults require 8 amino acids for health. Whilst animal protein is rich in all 8 amino acids, plant based foods (with the exception of soya and quinoa) do not contain all 8. If an amino acid is missing, this is known as the limiting amino acid. -In cereals the limiting amino acid is lysine and threonine.
-In rice it’s lysine
-In beans and pulses methionine
-In maize tryptophan and
-In seeds lysine and isoleucine. 
This means that it is vital to complement proteins by eating them at the same meal to make up for any shortfall. The body stores a short term supply of all 8 amino acids in what is known as the body-pool. If one of these amino acids if missing, the body cannot store the proteins from previous meals and they will be excreted as waste. 
If eating beans, add some methionine rich foods (Brazil nuts, almonds, sunflower seeds etc). If eating rice top up with beans to cover lysine shortfalls.

A continued shortage of amino acids can result in the body catabolizing (breaking-down) its own muscle to provide the missing amino acids. Long term this can sometimes alter body composition leading to a reduced level of lean muscle mass and an increased body and visceral (central) fat percentage which is undesirable.

The takeaway is this:
– cook from scratch most of the time
- reduce pre-packaged / processed foods and snacks
-eat pulses daily
- eat a wide range of foods from all food groups
- too up your plate with extras such as hummus, seeds, nuts or quinoa",26,"['This is really helpful! 👏', '#plantbased #powerofplants #vegan #veganuary #plantpower #savetheplanet #allplants #veganforhealth #veganfortheplanet #veganuary2020 #organic #loveyourbody #sustainability #veganfood #veganrecipes #spiceupyourlife #vegannutritiom #eatwell #detoxtime #doitright #eatmoreplants #allplants #veganprotein #vweareveganuary #feed_me_momma #', 'This is so helpful.

"It’s cold. It’s dark. Enter Soup Sundays! We’ll be sharing the recipe for a new, easy, delicious, and nourishing soup every Sunday this month. Starting with this one, Spiced Carrot Soup with toasted peanuts, garlic oil and coriander. Here’s what you need:(Serves 4-5)
2 tbsp olive oil
1 small red chilli, finely sliced 
2 leeks, sliced 
500g carrots, peeled and sliced 
400g potatoes, peeled and chopped 
1.5 litre vegetable stock
1 tsp salt 
1 lemon, juiced

To top:
Peanuts, roasted 
Fresh coriander
Garlic oil (recipe below)

For garlic oil (makes ⅓ cup):
6 cloves garlic, finely sliced 
⅓ cup olive oil 
Method: 
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chilli and leeks, and saute for 8-10 minutes, until translucent. Add the carrots, potatoes, vegetable stock and salt and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until both the carrots and potatoes are soft. Blend in a high speed blender, add lemon juice and taste for salt.

"I'm not a huge fan of pomelo but this spicy, sweet, tart, crunchy and nutty Thai #pomelosalad makes me craving for it again & again on hot days.  Such an addictive salad.
.
This is how I make the salad.
.
Dressing:
Chili padi - 1 pc
Young ginger (minced) - 2cm
Coconut sugar - 30g
Lime juice - 1 1/2 limes
@radiantwholefood.organic Liquid amino - 3/4 tsp
@tais_choice_kitchen organic belacan - 1/4 tsp

Salad:
Pomelo segments - 200g (break into bite size)
Kefir lime leaves - 4 pcs (finely sliced)
Lemongrass - 1 pc (white part only, thinly sliced)
Torch ginger flower - 1 Tbsp (finely sliced)
Toasted peanuts - 35g
Toasted shredded coconut - 2 Tbsp
Shredded king oyster mushroom - 1 medium (seasoned and sauteed)
Cilantro - handful (coarsely chopped)
Mint leaves - handful (coarsely chopped)

Method:
1. Pound chili, ginger and coconut sugar using mortar and pestle.
2. Add in lime juice, liquid amino and belacan, stir until the sugar has dissolved. 
3. Taste - to get a balance of hot, sweet, sour and salty. Add more sugar, lime juice or liquid amino if necessary. 
4. To make the salad, place pomelo segments and all other salad ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Gently toss the salad with enough amount of dressing to generously coat everything. 
5. Serve immediately. .

Two-ingredient pineapple soft serve aka homemade dole whip 🤤 Added a sprinkle of Tajin (chili lime spice) and was as delicious as it is on ripe mango! To make, just add frozen pineapple chunks to a food processor or high powered blender with a splash of coconut milk or cream and blend until smooth. Error on the side of too little milk then build up — you don’t want it runny. I started with the FP and finished with the blender. It wasn’t quite as airy as the real DW but taste was on point. If you like it sweeter, could add a lil maple syrup. #dairyfree #plantbased

"Vegan Alternatives friend or foe?
When we start to eat more plants, there is a tendency to try and replace the foods we enjoyed before with meat-free alternatives. 
These foods are often highly processed and the ingredients lists are often far from healthy or inviting. The key word here is nutrient density and most of these products fall short on nutrients including proteins, vitamins and minerals. In fact they are mostly low in plants and high in refined cereals and oils. 
Ingredients such as modified starch, maltodextrin, burnt sugar, rehydrated wheat protein, sulphites, colourings, cellulose extract, dextrose, vegetable gums, hypromellose, potassium sorbate, soya preparation are all ingredients that appear on the labels of so-called healthy ‘vegan’ alternatives.

Therefore simply being ‘vegan’ does not necessarily mean ‘healthy'. It depends how you choose to do it. There are so many foods to enjoy that are not meat, egg or cheese replacements that will give you more health benefits.

My advice is to take a step back away from the vegan aisles, tempting you to replace what you have taken out of your diet,  and instead start to think differently. Look around at all the foods that are naturally ‘plant-based’. Download some amazing vegan recipes, ‘follow’ the right people and start to use your own proteins as a base to your meals.

The trouble with replacing food like-for-like is that the cheese or egg-like product you can buy do not resemble cheese or egg in the slightest from a nutrient perspective. Processed vegan alternatives are often made from highly refined cereal grains and are disappointingly low in actual vegetables, whole grains or healthy fats. 
Many Vegan cheeses brands contain no protein at ALL and consist of just oils and refined starches. Nutritionally very different.

Therefore it would be better to use some nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavour (which contains B12) or to replace the cheese with chickpeas or tofu in a recipe.

Once you stop trying to replace cheese or burgers with processed alternatives, you should find that your diet becomes full of nutrient dense foods. It is about changing how you think about your food.

Did you know that every year, millions of babies are stolen from their mothers??🙄In the #dairy industry, male calves are torn away from their mothers shortly after birth and sold to the veal industry🐮 Many are confined to dark sheds where they will live their entire short lives chained by the neck in crates so small that they can't even turn around or lie down comfortably. When they are just a few weeks old, they will be killed😥Why does this happen? For one reason: DAIRY☝️Female cows only provide milk during and after pregnancy, so on dairy farms, they are repeatedly and forcibly impregnated. They will suffer the same fate as their mothers, as they will be treated like milk-producing machines until they are slaughtered for meat. Dairy means cruelty and violence😞Be part of the @AntiDairySocialClub and help save babies by ditching dairy and purchasing healthy and delicious plant-based alternatives💚 #DitchDairy .

"A curry for for Veganuary! Butternut and sweet potato with red lentils, pumpkin seeds and quinoa for the protein. I also added some organic spinach, timed tomatoes and coconut milk for added depth of flavours. 
I have made this curry a few times, but I change some of the ingredients around each time. Root vegetables are low glycaemic and provide lots of fibre for the microbiome. They are also really satisfying. 
Mixing the lentils with the quinoa and the seeds increases the amino acid profile of our food and also the amount of protein we can actually use from our meal. I could also have added some chickpeas or some tahini for even more nutrients. 
Be bold when you cook vegan food. Go back to the drawing board and THINK BIG! Try out new foods and ingredients. Maybe look at clips from @bosh.tv to help inspire you! These guys are great at making vegan food look fun and delicious. 
I have posted this recipe before so please look it up. Also, if you don’t have all the ingredients- don’t panic, just try swapping something out for something you do have e.g. pumpkin or carrots for the butternut squash,  or kale for spinach, or you could even add quinoa instead of the lentils!  etc. 
I am always thinking about the Protein when I am making a meal that only contains plants as this is what fills us up and helps our body to repair and regenerate. 
If you come up with some good recipes- please tag me too!

"""Gado gado"" translates to 'mix-mix' in Indonesia.  Traditionally the dish is composed of a mixture of boiled vegetables and protein such as tempeh, eggs & tofu. I omitted the eggs and made it vegan. The highlight of this dish is the beautiful blend of savoury, slightly sweet and slightly spicy peanut sauce.  Quite satisfied with the sauce this time around, with added coconut milk, @tais_choice_kitchen belacan and my home fermented shoyu koji.  No pungent recipe 😁.

"Veganuary + Protein -is your serving size BIG enough?

It is possible to obtain sufficient Protein on a vegan diet, however it requires a little more planning than an omnivore diet. 
Protein is necessary for tissue repair, enzymes, many hormones, neurotransmitters and immunity. As with too much protein, there are implications when protein intake is too low. In particular, because carbohydrate intake tends to be higher as protein intake lowers. 
This can result in unbalanced blood glucose and insulin levels which can have other health implications. Fatigue, reduced muscle mass and hair loss can be common symptoms of low protein levels, as well as elevated triglycerides and cholesterol from excess carbohydrates.

Vegan sources of protein include soya (tofu, tempeh, Edamame, soya beans), nuts and seeds, peas, beans and lentils, quinoa and amaranth. Protein is also found in wholegrains such as rice and oats. In fact many foods contain some proteins, therefore mixing them all up by eating a diverse diet is the best way to cover requirements.

Portion size is therefore crucial, 100g tofu or 140g cooked beans or lentils or a small handful of nuts and seeds are a normal meal portion size for an adult. This means that they really do become star of the show in a recipe and not simply an afterthought. Not eating sufficient protein foods leads to us filling up on the carbs such as rice, bread or potatoes. 
Protein is very satiating (as are fats) and eating protein tells our body that we are full-up which can naturally help control our appetite.

Every bite counts! Snacks as well as meals need to contain some form of protein food – hummus and oat cakes, porridge bowls, nut butter on rye bread, nuts and fruit are all suitable protein rich snacks as opposed to simply grazing on toast, refined breakfast cereals or biscuits.

Swapping foods form vegan alternatives doesn't always offer a like-for-like in nutrients. Most vegan cheeses contain no protein at all - so we need  to eat different foods to replace them and think BIGGER! Such as more beans and less vegan cheese🧀 
Don’t forget that I will be posting an extended video on this topic later today!

"The biggest challenge for me is eating properly. Come to find out eating right is literally 80% of this journey... I can't out work caloric overload. 
Even though that wrap was so nice, and the burger was hella juicy with the cheese dripping, and the calzone with barbecue base was poppin' and dont get me started on my mums fried fish, how it hits so right after a long day at work, these fleeting moments only result in me passing out from the iris, clutching at my belly feeling disgusted with myself.

Although I don't sit in the mirror taunting myself, my brain is literally in overdrive with thoughts of how much I have failed myself, yet again.

Even my colleagues at work have nothing to say about my terrible eating habits. They have seen me sneak meat even though I gave it up a couple years back. They seem to quietly revel in my weakness which basically means they're slagging me off behind my back because they were all too vocal about my drinking slot of water, and eating pesca-vegan meals and being organised and feeling really good.

More importantly,  my body is protesting me constantly. Where my right knee used to feel the pain, that I then got rid of, my left has now joined the chanting and screams louder. My tummy hurts from being over full, to the point that hours after I have eaten I need to throw up to feel relief - this has only happened a few times but I know a tragedy developing when I see it. Most recently,  my lower back has begun to ache, a pain I, despite having heavy boobs, have not experienced since I was a pre-teen when they first arrived. 
When I did OMAD last year I felt great but I did not measure my calories. I just stopped when I was full - yes the food was way healthier but excess is excess. This time around I will monitor more closely to stay in deficit. I'm also going to start ensuring I am encouraging ketosis regularly again too.

My shopping list is set. Let me go sort this 80% out.

And comment below if you have any veg you want pimping up! Here's what you need (to serve 6):
600g carrots, sliced
2 white onions, sliced
2 tbsp olive oil 
½ tsp sea salt
200g cooked barley
50g dill 
20g tarragon
½ lemon, juiced
2 tbsp garlic oil (recipe below)
Garlic oil (makes ⅓ cup)
6 cloves garlic, sliced 
70g olive oil

Method:
Preheat your oven to 180˚C. Toss the sliced carrots and sliced white onions onto a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and salt and mix.  Roast for 25 minutes, until are edges start crisping. Add the cooked barley to the tray, mix, and drizzle with remaining tbsp of olive oil.

Roast for another 10-12 minutes, until the barley is crispy and the edges of the carrots/onions have browned. Stir the dill, tarragon and lemon juice through the grain/veg and drizzle with a couple tbsp garlic oil.

To make the garlic oil, add oil and garlic to a small sauce pan. Simmer the garlic, stirring often, until golden. Transfer both the oil and garlic to a bowl and let cool. Store in a jar at room temperature, and use it to top soups, salads, veg and pasta!",586,"['#vegan #vegansofig #allplants #foodie #chef #london #veganbusiness #health #january #food #instavegan #instafood #teamgamechangers #gamechangers', 'This looks delicious!! 😍', '@tomfarrall_ this is all I ever need 🤤🤤🤤']",allplants
"🍞🌟Squeezing in as much baking, eating, gorging until Monday when all the new 2020 face-stuffage rules commence. .
✨Organic walnut, raisin, cranberry wheat bread, toasted and slathered in @miyokoscreamery butter. ☀️Easy recipe. Basically wheat flour, bread flour, salt, water, yeast, and several handfuls of chopped walnuts, raisins and dried cranberries. This recipe called for a quick rise yeast, and letting it be for about 7 hrs before putting it in the oven. (I hide mine in a warm clothes dryer for 7 hrs, covered in a damp towel to help the rise) 🔥Toasting this bread takes it to another level. So that’s what I suggest. I also suggest going for a half marathon run after all these carbs.  That, which I will not be doing today or any day soon. 😂 .
Next week I’m planning on another, ....this time...only 3 day fast. If anyone wants to join me, now is the time to start mentally gearing up. I’m looking forward to the cleanse and welcome the company. But until then, I’m thoroughly enjoying the indulgences. .
.
💫It’s gonna be a great year with a lot of goal realizations. For everyone. Even if your goals don’t work out, you still get information that you need to move forward. You simply re-adjust the goal, and continue. It’s always a win. Move forward. No lamenting. Maybe try new things. (Like vegan foods?? 😜)Get a little uncomfortable. 
Shelve your (vegan) waffling. No hemming and hawing. Just doing and knowing and believing you’re improving something in your life.💖 .
Happiest 2020 to you all. :) 🥰🔥",40,['#veganuary #create #veganuary2020#plantbased #veganpower #plantstagram #livekindly #meatless #dairyfree #ditchdairy #veganfortheanimals #veganholidays #veganbread #veganfoodshare \n#homemadebread #veganmom #plantbased #veganmomma #plantstagram #vegangirls #allplants #veganfoodshare\n#organicwheatbread'],allplants

"It is Veganuary time again, where many of you will be going plant based for the month to reap the health benefits and to support the environment. 
There are amazing benefits from eating much more plants in our diet and it is true that most people feel amazing when starting out on a vegan diet. 
This is because it acts as  super-charged detox. Many of the nutrients consumed can help support liver function and detoxification pathways and most of the foods are nutrient dense and natural. However this is not always the case- please see future posts regarding some of the ‘healthy’- vegan supermarket alternatives. 
Also, some known allergenic foods (such as dairy) are naturally excluded from the diet, so some people may feel even more benefits than others. 
As a nutritionist, I have helped many people on plant-based diets understand the benefits and nutritional implications of following a vegan diet long term. 
Over the next few posts I will tease out the science on nutrients, nutrient availability and possible supplements that may help support a healthy plant based diet as well as any pitfalls. 
Watch this space for more tips!

"A banging brunch to kick off the new year. What could be better?! Get the ingredients ready, then get ready to enjoy ⚡️ Here's what you need:
Potato rostis: 
4 large potatoes (around 600g)
1 yellow onion
½ tsp salt 
1 tsp cumin
¼ tsp pepper 
3 tbsp olive oil (to fry)

Green Cannellini-Bean Dip: 
400g cooked cannellini beans (1 tin)
½ cup cooked peas 
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp tahini
½ tsp salt
1 lemon, juiced
25g mixed herbs (we used coriander + mint)
¼ cup water 
Dressing:
2 tbsp plant-based yoghurt
1 ½ tsp grainy mustard
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp olive oil
¼ tsp salt 
To serve:
2 avocados
10-15 cherry tomatoes
4 slices rye bread 
Method: 
To make the potato rostis, grate the potatoes and onion with a box grater, into a colander placed over a bowl. Season with salt and let sit for 15 minutes. Squeeze the potatoes and onion of any excess liquid and transfer to a bowl. Add cumin and pepper and mix. Heat the oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. While it heats, use your hands to form small patties out of your grated potatoes and transfer to the pan. Cook around 4 at a time, letting them cook for around 10 minutes at a time. When golden on each side, transfer to a dish lined with kitchen roll. Repeat with the rest of the rostis. 
To make the cannellini bean dip:
Add your cannellini beans, peas, olive oil, tahini, salt, lemon juice, herbs and water to a food processor or blender. Blend on high for 2-3 minutes, until smooth and creamy. Taste for salt and adjust to taste. 
To make the dressing, add the yoghurt, mustard, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, olive oil and salt into a small bowl and mix until fully combined. Taste for salt/acidity/sweetness and adjust to taste. 
Slice your avocado into quarters, toast your bread and slice your cherry tomatoes. Build your dish up starting with your dip, followed by 2 potato rostis, avocado, bread, cherry tomatoes and dressing. Sprinkle with zataar or your favourite seeds/nuts/spices. 
Note: This dish also makes a great savoury sandwich!

"Curious about psychedelic plants? Yes they are pretty neat.. yet... Have you ever imagined working with common plants in a multidimensional way? Have you ever felt drawn to a specific plant and not knowing why? 
Have you ever found yourself talking to a flower or a tree?
Do you find yourself wondering what the medicinal properties of plants are? Do you wonder how you can develop your intuition while exploring the Plant World? I've spent most of my life wondering about these things and discovered that we all have the ability to truly listen and connect with the plant kingdom if we take the time to listen. Many plants have been waiting their whole lives for us to start talking to them. They are here to help us and we are here to help them thrive. Relationships with plants are a co-creative beautiful partnership that restores harmony within us and helps this planet beyond measure.
I used to think psychotropic plants could only take me into higher levels of consciousness.. ha ha!! . once I started developing a relationship with common plants in journeying with them I realized that these ""ordinary""  plants are incredibly psychedelic and incredible beings!

The mentorship that I'm offering in 2020 is an eight-month container for you to deepen your intuition while working with plants. We meet for 2 days a month and dive deeply into the spirit realm of plants in a group atmosphere. Your classroom will be outside and Fireside each day amongst 75 acres of  carolinian forest. Next year will be the third year running this Folk herbalism and Gaian mentorship here at the Gaia Hive. We are near Dundas Ontario and 1 hour from Toronto.  Check out www.JulieGaia.ca for the year's outline. Join our living school of plant connection and wisdom! There here 7 spaces left in the weekday group!

This foto is of a 2019 student connecting with Sacred tobacco amongst a late tulsi & pawpaw patch. I Grow It For The First Peoples of this land and to honour them & it flourishes.  I do not teach about this plant for it is not my medicine. I can connect you with First peoples from here that do.  May my work be a rainbow bridge. Much love.

There are so many things growing in my own backyard or the woods near my house that I never knew were edible or medicinal.

Even the way they grow (reminiscent of the neural network) implies they are amazing medicines for all beings 😊 love what you are offering in your programs, I wish I was closer to Canada!']",allplants

"Weekend waffles – aka your new hangover cure. Master them before New Year’s Day and thank yourselves later.
Oh and p.s. - they’re gluten free AND you can use the batter for pancakes, too 💥 
Here’s what you need: 
Waffles:
300g silken tofu 100ml plant milk
3 tbsp olive oil
130g gluten free flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp baking powder 
1⁄4 tsp salt
Vanilla Cashew Cream:
1⁄2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2-3 hours 100 ml water
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 vanilla beans, scraped
Pinch of salt
Method:
To make your waffles, start by combining the tofu, milk and olive oil in a blender. Blend on high for around 30 seconds, until smooth and creamy. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and add the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix lightly until combined.
Heat a waffle iron according to its instructions, and then brush a little olive or coconut oil onto it. Pour a ladle-full of batter into your waffle iron, until it’s around 3⁄4 way full. Cook until your waffle is golden (3-4 minutes). Repeat with the rest of the batter.
To make your cashew cream, combined soaked cashews, water, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in a blender and mix on high for 3-4 minutes, until completely smooth.
Serve your waffles topped with a couple spoonfuls of cashew cream, maple syrup and fruit.",225,['#allplants #waffles #pancakes #glutenfree #glutenfreebaking #glutenfreecooking #veganrecipes #glutenfreevegan #vegansofig #recipes #foodies #veganwaffles #veganfoodshare #teamgamechangers #gamechangers'],allplants

"Banana Walnut Pancakes

Our go to breakfast treat. These fluffy pancakes taste great loaded with fresh berries and maple syrup! Yum!
.
.
The Essentials:
2 cups GF oat flour (we just blend up some GF oats)
1.5 cups GF all purpose flour 
½ cup almond flour
1.5 Tbsp baking powder 
1 tsp sea salt
1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
2 med. ripe bananas
3 Tbsp melted coconut oil (plus more for cooking)
1.5 Tbsp vanilla extract 
2.5 Tbsp maple syrup 
2 ¼ cups non-dairy milk (we like to use oat or coconut)
¾ cups chopped walnuts
¼ cup GF rolled oats 
Top with, or blend in, hand full of berries (we add in frozen wild blueberries and/or top with fresh berries)
.
.
The Steps:
In a large bowl add oat flour, GF all purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and whisk together.
In separate bowl, mash bananas and add coconut oil, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and non-dairy milk and whisk together. (you may have to microwave for 1 minute if coconut oil begins to harden)
Add wet ingredients to dry and fold together. 
Fold in chopped walnuts, oats and any berries you wish to add (optional) 
Heat large skillet/griddle over medium heat and rub with coconut oil.
Once hot, spoon batter onto skillet and cook until bubbles begin to appear and flip (roughly 2 min each side)
Continue cooking until amount of pancakes desired are cooked - batter can be refrigerated. 
Top with favorite toppings and enjoy!
Recipe makes about 15 large pancakes or 25-30 small pancakes.

Ingredients:
🔸 2/3 packets of Oreos (depending on size of cake)
🔸 @nakulaorganic cream cheese
🔸Coconut whipped cream (From coconut Cream) 🔸Pack of Strawberries
🔸 @sogoodau Dairy-Free Vanilla Bliss
🔸Any plant mylk 🌱
*optional: Vanilla extract & cinnamon
Instructions:
🔹 A few days before making cake place good quality coconut cream in the fridge
🔹Oil a @pyrexaus mixing bowl with melted coconut oil
🔹Seperate oreo cookies from frosting and place frosting into a metal mixing bowl and cookies on a plate
🔹Pour a glass of plant milk and dip the Oreo cookies in the milk, then carefully placing them face down into the glass bowl until entire base is filled to the rim
🔹 Dice strawberries
-
🔹 Depending on size of bowl add 1/2 - full container of cream cheese into seperate mixing bowl
🔹 Crack open can of coconut milk and carefully scoop out the coconut cream solids from top of the can and add to bowl. Leave out coconut water at the bottom of the can (you can add this to a curry)
🔹 Add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla, entire tub of Vanilla Bliss and whip the contents of the metal bowl until combined
🔹 begin spreading a layer of the ice cream mixture at the bottom followed by a sprinkling of strawberries, ice cream mixture then mylk dipped Oreos. Repeat this process until entire bowl is full then cover the base (top rim) with a layer of mylk dipped Oreos
🔹 Cover with a saucepan lid, fabric cover or even a kitchen towel and pop it into the freezer over night.
To release:
🔺Add boiled water to a bowl slight larger than the glass bowl until a third of the way
🔺 Take out ice cream cake from the freezer; dunk and HOLD the ice cream cake bowl into the hot water bowl for about 2-3 minutes so the coconut oil can melt and the cake to release. DO NOT just leave it in or the bottom/top will not melt the coconut oil properly. Like mine 😅
🔺After a few minutes pop a plate larger than the diameter over the bowl and FLIP!

"Christmas is ruined*, thanks to our creative cooking queen Valentina making American stuffing instead of the British stuff. *Ok so it was actually VERY good. Give it a go.

Ingredients:
500g crusty bread, torn apart
2 tbsp olive oil
1 leek, sliced
2 celery sticks, finely diced
500g mushrooms, finely diced
4 tbsp thyme, chopped
3 tbsp fresh sage, chopped 
1 tsp salt
1 apple, finely diced
60g walnuts, chopped
4 tbsp plant based butter, melted
300ml vegetable stock

Method:
Preheat your oven to 120˚C. Spread the bread chunks on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the outsides have dried but the chunks can still be pressed into. Remove the tray from the oven and raise the heat to 180˚C.

Heat the olive oil in a large pan (we used a cast iron skillet) over medium heat and add in the leeks and celery. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until they are translucent and starting to caramelise. Add the mushrooms and let cook, untouched, for 6-8 minutes, after which you can stir and add the thyme, sage and salt. Cook for another 8-10 minutes, until some of the mushrooms have crisped up.

Remove the pan/skillet from heat and add the bread to the skillet and stir to combine, until the sautéed veg is evenly distributed amongst the bread chunks. Add the diced apple, walnuts, melted butter and stock and gently mix together to combine. If you're using a cast iron skillet, then you can bake the stuffing directly in that. If not, transfer the mixture onto a large buttered baking dish.

Cover the baking dish or skillet with foil and bake covered for 25 minutes. Uncover the baking dish/skillet and let roast for another 20-25 minutes. Baking it in two stages (one covered and one uncovered) makes the interior of every bite soft and the exterior crunchy - don't skip this! Remove from oven, let cool for 10 minutes and tuck in!",297,"['#stuffing #vegan #veganrecipes #veganfoodshare #vegansofig #allplants #veganchristmas #plantbased #foodie #love #comfortfood', ""What's the recipe?"", 'Just ordered my first box of meals coming on the 31december... looking forward to sharing my meal posts with you soon🧚\u200d♀️🍽', 'You don’t seem to have an option for larger families (feeding 5.)

"Blueberry Lemon Muffins

These delicious muffins make for a great breakfast treat, snack or dessert! Great for anytime of the year. Enjoy!
.
.
Ingredients 
1 tbsp Flaxseed Meal + 3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup dairy-free milk - we use oat or coconut 
1 tbsp lemon juice 
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp cashew butter 
2 tbsp lemon zest 
2 cups oat flour - we just blend up some GF oats 
1/2 cup almond flour
1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup fresh blueberries
.
.
Method 
Preheat the oven to 350°F then lightly grease a muffin tin or line with baking cups.
In a small bowl, whisk  flax with water. Set aside to thicken.
In a medium bowl, combine non dairy milk and lemon juice and stir together. In the same bowl, add applesauce, maple syrup, vanilla, cashew butter and lemon zest. Whisk until smooth. 
In a large bowl, whisk together oat flour, almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Pour the flax mixture into this bowl, as well as the liquids in the medium bowl. Add 1/2 of the blueberries and fold together until combined. 
Fill each muffin tin 3/4 of the way full then garnish the tops with remaining blueberries. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until light golden brown and cooked through. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes. Serve and enjoy! .

"Grocery haul from Costco.  As I post this, apparently there’s news that The Gamechangers star @lightningwilks - James “Lightning” Wilks’ wife @plantedmom, got criticized of her grocery shopping cart having all these vegan products that are processed, and anti-vegans are having a ball capitalizing on it on their pages.  To her defense, here’s a thought- since when were burgers, pizza, tacos, lasagna, pancakes, waffles, donuts, ice cream, foods people love, considered healthy?  Nobody’s saying that the veganized versions of these foods are healthy.  Just because a product is vegan doesn’t mean it’s healthy.  Vegan products are simply conscious ethical products, made from plants, that are a healthy-ER alternative for indulgence, and always 100% #cholesterolfree, #crueltyfree and #ecofriendly, just as good but won’t promote clogged arteries.  Eating whole food plant based is the actual message, but even that gets criticized as boring rabbit food, and vegans are depriving themselves of good food.  Then when we veganize foods that people love that turns out so good, like the Impossible & Beyond Burgers for example, it’ll be criticized as processed this and that.  So either way, haters will criticize.  Personally, I’ll take processed over heart attack, carcinogens & cruelty any day, so ignore the nonesense and continue living a compassionate life that aligns with your values, while still enjoying vegan junk food that won’t clog your arteries.  Balance is key.  Eat plants, exercise, have cheat days, repeat, and still have awesome bloodwork results.  As vegans, let’s not be too judgmental of people.  It doesn’t help our cause.  This is the beginning of why people get too butt hurt and become anti-vegans.  There’s the proper and nicer approach to educating.  The ones that are willing to go vegan will, the ones that won’t, won’t.  We’ve done our part to help, respect people regardless. Unfortunately, some will take it the wrong way.  Sorry to say, they will just have to find out the hard way from nature and continue to be a statistic.  Speaking of @gamechangersmovie , if you haven’t seen it, check it out, now on Netflix.

Hey you! Yeah you, scrolling through social media looking at ways to spend money. Have you considered giving to our Kickstarter to get cool stuff and help out a growing family?! We know there may be some confusion on what we do and how we make it. For starters, we are 95% oil free and 110% processed food free...making our food and drinks out of whole food plants.

We love community so we will be hosting community potlucks, teaching classes at local schools, partnering with doctors, health coaching those that seek it, and reaching out into the underserved communities in Chattanooga to teach people how to take control of their own wellness. To help reach these goals our new hours will be:

Monday-Thursday 7:30 am - 6 pm
Friday 8 am - 9 pm
Saturday 9 am - 9 pm
Sunday 11 am - 2 pm

We will have street parking, outdoor seating, a drink menu, and expanding our current menu to include pizza, hot pockets (hand pies), donuts, cinnamon rolls, pin wheels, muffins, cakes, mylk shakes, cauliflower wings, Buddha bowls, biscuits and gravy, queso dip, bagels, cookies, breads, home fries, cocktails and mock tails, plus some other things we haven’t even thought of yet. 
We wanted to show you a sampling of things we will be capable of at the new location, but we can’t do it without your help. Take it all in and be careful not to drool on your screen (unless your phone is water proof). “GET BACK TO YOUR ROOTS”

"It’s easy being (cauliflower) cheesy with this classic to add to your Christmas dinner. 
Ingredients:
Serves 6 
2 small heads cauliflower (around 600g), cut into wedges/slices 
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp flaky salt 
125g cashews, soaked in boiling water for at least 30 minutes
1 tbsp miso
1 tsp whole grain mustard
2 tbsp nutritional yeast 
½ tsp black pepper
1 lemon, juiced 
3 cloves garlic, peeled
200ml oat milk
4 tbsp fresh parsley and chives (optional)

Method: 
Preheat your oven to 190˚C. Transfer the cauliflower wedges into a ceramic/tin baking tray and toss in olive oil and salt. Roast for 30-35 minutes, until soft and starting to brown. 
In the meantime, make the cheese sauce. Add the cashews, miso, mustard, nutritional yeast, balck pepper, lemon juice, garlic cloves and milk to a blender and mix on high for 3-4 minutes, until completely smooth. Once the cauliflower has roasted, evenly pour the cheese sauce over and in between the wedges of cauliflower. Place the tray back in the oven and roast for another 6-8 minutes, until the sauce has set but still jiggles when you (lightly) shake the tray. Top with fresh parsley and chives. Serve hot!",374,"['#cheese #vegancheese #cauliflowercheese #vegancauliflowercheese #veganfoodshare #veganrecipes #foodie #tasty #allplants #veganchristmas', '😋😋😋 miso is cheesy sauce is a winner 👌', 'Easy cheesy champ ✨💛']",allplants

"Why do we take supplements?⁠
⁠
In a perfect world, we'd get plenty of sleep, be permanently hydrated, and eat all the fruits and vegetables of the world! But no matter how healthy your lifestyle may be, there are strong reasons show that you need to take dietary supplements!⁠
⁠
Here are 7 powerful reasons as to why.⁠
⁠
1.  Filling the nutritional gap.⁠
90% of people don't get the recommended amount of important nutrients from food alone. Most of us fail to meet dietary recommendations due to strict dieting, poor appetite, or changing nutritional needs.⁠
⁠
2. Nutrient absorption declines with age.⁠
As you age, malabsorption becomes a problem because your body doesn’t have the same capability to break down and absorb nutrients as it used to. ⁠
⁠
3. Harmful chemicals.⁠
Pesticides and herbicides used to farm our food, chemicals found in our water supply, and external environmental issues like pollution drastically increase our need for extra vitamins and minerals.⁠
⁠
4. Exercise increases our nutrient needs.⁠
It is vital to replenish these essential nutrients, fuel your energy levels, and promote recovery after an intense workout. ⁠
⁠
5. Poor eating habits⁠
Erratic eating habits, eating processed junk food, and stress contribute to poor digestion, making it difficult for our bodies to extract all the nutrients it needs from food.⁠
⁠
6. Prevent expensive health issues.⁠
Taking daily supplements, getting regular exercise, and making frequent trips to the doctors are important for preventing costly health issues from arising in the future.⁠
⁠
7. Soil depletion⁠
Modern farming techniques use fertilizers that deplete the soil and rob the plants of essential nutrients. Fertile soil is a crucial agriculture element for absorbing the proper amounts of minerals. Without this, the plant cannot form essential vitamins.⁠
⁠
Let us know what you think!⁠

2 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash
1-2 cups cups cubed yukon gold potatoes 
1/4 tsp ground allspice
Pinch cayenne pepper; more to taste
Sea salt to taste
1-1.5 quarts of vegetable broth - we typically buy two quarts and add more as needed 
1 14.5-oz. can fire-roasted tomatoes 
4-6 sprigs fresh thyme
2 cups lightly packed, coarsely chopped kale
1 cup canned chickpeas drained.
.
Steps:
Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. 
Add carrots, celery and onion, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 6 minutes. 
Add garlic and cook for 1 min more. 
Add squash, potatoes, allspice, cayenne, and 1 tsp. salt and stir
Add broth, tomatoes with their juice, and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
Add kale and chickpeas and cook uncovered until squash and potatoes are tender and the kale has wilted, about 10 minutes more. 
Discard the thyme springs before serving. Season to taste with more salt and cayenne and enjoy!

"Roasted, boiled, mashed… is there anything potatoes CAN’T do?!
Here’s two of our favourite potato recipes to add to your vegan Christmas dinner. 
For the roast potatoes:
(Serves 6)
1kg Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters 
6 cloves garlic
80g olive oil
1/2 tsp salt 
5 sprigs fresh rosemary
Method:
Preheat your oven to 180˚C. Transfer the potatoes to a large pot with 2 tbsp salt and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, until tender but not fully soft. Drain in a colander and let sit for 15 minutes. In the meantime, pour 2 tbsp of olive oil onto a baking tray and transfer to the oven (yes, with just the oil). Once you've let the parboiled potatoes sit, remove the tray from the oven, and transfer them to the heated tray. Add the remaining olive oil, salt and rosemary. Mix to combine using a spoon. Transfer the tray to the oven and roast for 40-45 minutes, turning the potatoes around every 15 minutes or so, to ensure every side is crispy. Remove from oven, let cool for 10 minutes, and serve topped with flaky sea salt. 
For the mashed potatoes: 
Ingredients: (Serves 6)
1 kg potatoes, peeled and quartered
4 tbsp olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
Sea salt and pepper 
2 tbsp chives, chopped 
Method 
Transfer the potatoes to a large pot with cold water (covering the potatoes by around 3 cm) and 2 tbsp salt. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 25-30 minutes, until potatoes are soft. 
Save 250ml of the cooking water, then drain the potatoes. Add the olive oil to the same (now empty) pot and heat. Add the minced garlic, and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until golden. Add the drained potatoes, along with 50ml of the reserved water. Mix with a potato masher, adding extra reserved water until you reach your desired mash consistency. Serve topped with ground black pepper and chopped chives.",851,"['You can boil then pre bake before you qtr them, also reduces cooking time on the day as you can pre bake day night before.', 'Looks perfect 🤤', 'Delicious! ❤️']",allplants

"Vegan Mac n cheese.
Sometimes you just have to try things.  I enjoy cooking so it’s easy for me this recipe was fairly simple.  Cheese sauce is potato’s, carrots, cashews, onion, garlic, nutritional yeast, almond milk and seasoning.  Is it the best absolutely not.  It needs to be played with but it’s a great start.  I used over garbanzo bean noodles and topped with broccoli.

Let’s just say I’m hooked now!! 🌿,20,"['#veganjerky #louisvillejerky #louisvillejerkyco #nobeef #allplants #vegansnacks  #blackandvegan #vegan #veganrecipes #veganbowlsforvegansouls #vegansofig #vegancommunity #veganfoodshare #veganlifestyle #veganlife #veganeatsplease #vegannutrition #veganfooddiary #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #plantbasedfood #plantbasedpower #plantbasedmeals #plantbasedliving #gawdesseats', 'Where did you get it?!?!

And it’s a wrap! 
Tohoku has a lot to offer despite not being in the tourist radar. I’ve met the friendliest people there and learned some words from difficult yet interesting Japanese dialects I heard. 
To all the locals, guesthouse/hostel staff, backpackers, fellow travellers/Couchsurfers I met, a big thank you for keeping me in company plus all the travel and life stories that inspired me to make a big move. Hope to see you all along the way. Keep in touch! 
To family and friends who greeted me while I was running around Tokyo, thanks for all the greetings! They are very much appreciated. I will be responding to them in the coming weeks. 
Off to Big Decisions 2020 and more travel experiences. See you next year, Hokkaido! It’s just a matter of whether I’ll still take the 4-hour flight I’m used to or a longer 10-12 hour flight.

For now, I guess I need to finish all the Tohoku blog posts as well as answer the “Why Japan?” question (which I hear over and over). #2019 #japan #endlessdiscovery #tohoku #akita #aomori #iwate #miyagi #sendai #fukushima #tokyo  #veganjapan #vegantravel #allplants  #crueltyfree #plantbased #travel #wallflowertravels #backpacking #wallflowergoesoutside #offbeatplaces #offthebeatenpath #bigdecisions2020 #bigdecisions #moveforward #movingon #airports",16,['My favorite airport💕'],allplants

We’d looked on happy cow and the only option was pizza express (I know they do amazing vegan pizza but wasn’t feeling it today) Quite by chance the little lady kicked off outside Mahalias and through the window I spotted vegan taco’s on a menu board - result!
We went in to discover not only Vegan tacos but @herby.4 tofu burgers and fully loaded fries too.
So tasty and despite it sounding like junk food, was bursting with fresh and nutritious ingredients.
Fabulous!

"So I've kept it quiet for what feels like an eternity, and finally I can announce what I have been working on for the last few months... (I'm not usually good at keeping secrets!) I have been working for @redrickshawfood as the Culinary Innovation and Development Lead Chef developing the newest and hottest recipe meal box on the market... @feastboxuk 
For months I have been developing recipes from all over the world to bring you authentic and delicious meals. My meals have been thoughtfully put together. My spice blends have been carefully created as well as beautifully balanced. I have spoken to numerous suppliers to get the best quality ingredients. 
The beauty of Feastbox is that you are are getting restaurant quality meals but made at home by YOU with ingredients provided by us! My recipes walk you through the ingredients and method, so what would have once felt terrifying to make yourself will now be a doddle!! We have a whole host of dishes from Indian to China to Persia to Thailand to Morocco to Sri Lanka for you to explore.

"very excited to share that I’m now apart of the #foodspringfamily 💚

After sampling loads of their products, (including the pancake mix post I did last week) I can confirm that their nutrition products are incredible. ✨ You guys might have noticed I haven’t collaborated with a nutrition brand yet and that’s because I am SO fussy when it comes to protein-products, so you have my word!

One thing that really stood out to me about their brand was the quality of their products.  Their protein is sourced from grass fed cows and their protein creams/spreads contain no palm oil 🤍

So excited to create some cooking and baking content using their products! If you like the look of their products you can use code Beckyfsg to save you some 💰

"Last Bikinipic-I swear😜
.
Many ask what I do for my body-as I feel fitter & better than with 20years...! Also I eat everything I want (and not too little), drinking Alcohol and don’t count calories! And I don‘t have much time for sports as I currently work from Monday-Saturday daily over 8hours. So how to stay fit, healthy & balanced?
.
- wherever I can I move outdoors by walking home, hiking or biking on Sundays, avoiding public transport

-intermittent fasting (I do 16:8), it lets me focusing better on everything & the cell‘s regeneration works at full speed. It healed my hormonal disbalance I had many years

-eating mindfully, I eat everything but more plantpased and if I go for diary or meat/fish/seafood I make sure it’s local food and organic. 

-drinking additional green smoothies with organic supplements (I order at #yoursuperfoods or #foodspring)
.
And for toning the body the #venuslegacy (Multipolar Radiofrequency combined with electric waves) @swissmedglow keeping in shape✔️

For nutrition lecture I highly recommend #derernährungskompass by Bas Kast

Have you ever wondered what hormone is responsible for your mood and feelings? Serotonin is the key hormone that stabilises our mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness. This hormone impacts your entire body. It enables brain cells and other nervous system cells to communicate with each other. Serotonin also helps with sleeping, eating, and digestion. However, if the brain has too little serotonin, it may lead to depression. If the brain has too much serotonin, it can lead to excessive nerve cell activity. It also helps reduce depression, regulate anxiety, and maintain bone health.",10,['•\n#TribalTransform #SaddleDrunk #LiveBarefoot #Vivobarefoot #UCAN #AncientandBrave  #Foodspring #MihaBodyTec #EMStraining #WattBike #EndlessPool  #Pilates #ReformerPilates #SwimSquad #RunSquad #StrengthTraining #FMS #PNOE #Ironman #Gym #SwimBikeRun #Triathlon #Chertsey #StainesUponThames #VirginiaWater #Weybridge #Surrey #GoTribal\n•\n•\n🔴⚫️ C O M E  J O I N  T H E  T R I B E 🔴⚫️'],foodspring

Who is ready for some hearty vegan brunch? 🫑🥒🥦 

I used @lindamccartneyfoods red chorizo sausages, these are my absolute fave and taste so good! 😋

I also baked some broccoli and asparagus in the oven and seasoned with olive oil etc. 

I made the masala beans by cutting up some red onion, green chilli and adding garam masala. I then added the beans and mixed together...tastes A1 💯 

The avocado toast was made by smashing up 1 avocado and adding lemon juice (along with salt and pepper, chilli flakes). I then added this to sourdough bread!

"I made one of my favorite meals from HelloFresh again 😉 Delicious as usual. “Mushroom and Herb Shepherd’s Pie topped with White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes” 🥔 I mixed parmesan cheese with a bit of olive oil and breadcrumbs, then sprinkled it on top of the mashed potatoes and put it in the oven on broil for 3-5 minutes. It achieved this amazing crispy topping 😍🤤

"Food guilt anyone?

Let’s chat a sec about food shame. I am all about eating healthy and having a balanced relationship with all food. But, certain days are harder than others🤷🏻‍♀️
Due to this crazy weather we have had, I wasn’t able to get to the grocery store, so guess what I’ve eaten... a frozen pizza last night, grilled cheese from Starbucks today (which is the best ever), and finishing it up with another frozen pizza tonight!
So, here are my options- I could feel guilt and shame for these food choices OR I could remember that these last few days have been hectic, therefor I’m going to give myself some grace and enjoy this dang food! THE THING IS (and this is key) I will not let that become an excuse to continue the cycle. That is where I think people get stuck- once they have one bad thing they continue it over and over again. Don’t allow the cycle to continue!
Be proactive!!! Today I went grocery shopping and I have my balanced meals and snacks
planned out for the next week!! It’s a choice not to stay in the cycle of junk eating, but do not shame yourself while you are there!!!

"Our last @hellofresh box from the crazy boxes (and there’s not a box this coming week- sorry peeps!) was a cranberry pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes. There were supposed to be green beans, but because they had already been mostly frozen and then in the fridge for a week, they were too mushy to actually be cooked. The pork was nice and juicy, but I think “cranberry pork” might have been a misnomer. Not much cranberry, more ginger, rosemary, and chicken stock. It was good, but not what I expected. And green beans would’ve been good, but oh well. Mashed potatoes were good though!

—-💚Hello Fresh💚—— We picked 2 dinners for this week and made our first one tonight.  They have an app that makes it super convenient letting you choose your meals to be delivered on the same day each week.  Despite the snow, our box arrived on time yesterday and it was so fun checking everything out. 
I do realize that you could pay much less buying these ingredients, but everything was so easy, already measured and only required a little prep work.  For some reason, just seeing the photo of what we would be having for dinner really got Everett excited😂..... Him and Brayden helped me make it and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was nice not thinking about dinner for once and I’m already excited to try our other choice on Sunday!

"Happy Friday! What are you having tonight to ring in the weekend? 🥂

I suggest this dynamite vegetarian dish - Falafel pasta from #hellofresh. I've never cooked couscous, but I also didn't know Israeli couscous is actually pasta! Love the pearl pasta texture 😍

They post their recipes online and with ingredients you can easily find at your local grocery store.

If you're looking for a fresh, vegetarian dish that's easy to make, look up this recipe. The saltiness from the olives and feta, freshness of cilantro and parsley and popping roasted tomatoes and zucchini bring this dish together. Side note - cilantro tastes soapy to me and I didn't even notice....this dish likely could use a bit more cilantro. We'll definitely be making this again.

✖️ Would prefer more spice 

2. Sweet Chilli Halloumi Burgers with Wedges and Salad, 3/10 ⭐️
✔️ Wedges were great 
✖️Some lettuce and grated carrot... can you reeeeeeeallly call that a salad ?! 
✖️I really didn’t enjoy the burgers- too much pepper for halloumi & a slimy and a too soft texture 

3. Smokey BBQ Chicken & Blackbean loaded Wedges 7.5/10 ⭐️
✔️ I’m currently very stuffed 
✔️ The bbq chicken sauce was top notch 👌
✖️ Again would prefer more spring onion to garnish with 
✖️ 30g of cheese ? Behave. 

So apart from the slight mishap of forgetting the meat & cheese which required SO MUCH EFFORT to then go to the shops and replace, 2/3 meals were pretty dam good !

"PLEASE READ:

So y’all...I’m stepping wayyyyyyy outside of my comfort zone with this one. 

I’ve decided to start making vegan food boxes once a month. It’ll be similar to Hello Fresh (if you’ve ever heard of them) but completely vegan and already prepared/cooked. All recipes with be allergy friendly with the exception of gluten! I think this will be a great way to expose people to the wonderfully curated recipes I come up with. So, with that being said...I’m going to explain how it’ll work. 

Each box will contain:
•Soup (cup)
•Entree
•3 chocolate chip cookies
(it’ll always be chocolate chip)
•fresh pressed juice (12 oz.) 

Cost PER BOX: $30 (delivery included)

As of right now, the only item available a la carte will be the chocolate chip cookies. 

••••12 cookies for $15.

Of course, everything will be made fresh. 

Each month, I will prepare something different,  with the exception of the cookies. 

I will also release the menu for that month at the beginning of each month. 

Packages will be delivered the 3rd week of each month. 
•••••
I will notify each person their delivery date and time frame in advance. 
•••••

Only 25 boxes available each month!!! 

Right now...I can only deliver in the Detroit/ Metro Detroit area!!!

Let’s start doing the things that come to our mind. Actions speak way louder than words. I will use what God blessed me with to help others. I hope this works y’all. All I can do is try. Let’s do this!!!! 

••••I always say this, but I’m a very detailed oriented person and I try my best to keep everything clean and organized.

 *A mustard seed is all you need*

 (A mask will be worn and surfaces will be properly cleaned and sanitized) 

••••Cash app or Apple Cash are the only forms of payment accepted as of right now. ••••Payments MUST be received BEFORE delivery. 
••••I keep my word and I’ll have your package ready ON TIME. Life happens, so If anything prevents me from doing so, I will notify you ASAP. 

Feel free to ask me any questions via messenger or text. I’m pretty open! 

Spread the word to everyone you know!!!

"@maryanna_5 bought a month subscription to @hellofresh . I was skeptical at first, mainly because of the price per meal. I think if you're feeding a family of 4 or more, in no way does it make sense.  Grocery buying would be much cheaper.  But, with only 1 or two people to feed, this is actually a great option. Zero food waste is a good feeling.  Plus the time and money wasted at the grocery store is mitigated greatly.  And the next that it comes with very detailed recipe cards means that you can go to the store and replicate the meals without having to buy Hello Fresh again. 

This first recipe Maryanna cooked for us, chicken tabbouleh bowls, is a top-notch banger! I love middle eastern and mediterranean flavored dishes. We only added a little touch of a secret ingredient, Sumac. The chicken was juicy, and the tabbouleh was refreshing and bright with a nice crunch.

I'm not getting paid to say any of this, nor do I get any discounts for getting you to join this cult, but give it a try. I'll try to post each meal and give my thoughts.

Rump Steak, Herby Yorkshires & Truffled Roasties.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Wow. This was definitely worth paying abit extra! We didn’t bother doing the broccoli. We also made double the gravy and we’re glad we did. We wouldn’t have had enough if we used the amount for 2 people.

I was really pleased how the yorkies turned out and I’m definitely converted into using truffle oil with roast potatoes.

I didn’t miss the burger bun at all with the cheese and caramelised onions on top it was was so yummy! 

Loved it with the sweet potato wedges and salad with balsamic dressing.

"@hellofreshuk Sweet & Sour style chicken with pepper & bulgur wheat. Kept seeing this one pop up on the menu but didn’t really fancy it, I think because I thought the bulgur wheat wouldn’t really go with the sweet & sour. But...actually, really glad I ordered it in the end as it was really tasty and we both enjoyed the bulgur wheat with it. Will definitely remake-really easy to cook too. Great Friday night fakeaway!

"CREAMY BACON & MUSTARD PENNE WITH PEAR AND FETA CHEESE SALAD

A quick and easy @hellofreshuk meal with lots of taste and options to tweak it for your liking.

Serves 2

I N G R E D I E N T S

1 garlic clove
1 shallot 
Baby gem lettuce 
1 pear
200g penne pasta 
60g bacon lardons
200ml chicken stock
2 tbsp wholegrain mustard 
40g parmesam cheese 
100g creme fraiche 
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp cider vinegar 
100g feta 
1 tbsp olive oil 

M E T H O D

1. Bring a pan of water to the boil for the pasta with a pinch of salt. Once cooked and drained, drizzle with some olive oil. 

2. Meanwhile, heat a splash of oil in a frying pan and heat to medium-high. Add the bacon lardons and cooked until browned.

3. Thinly slice the shallot and add to the pan. Once the onion is softened add in the crushed garlic and cook for a further minute. 

4. Add the chicken stock and 1 tbsp of the mustard. Bring to the boil.

5. Once the stock is boiling, add half the parmesan and the creme fraiche to the pan. Stir until the cheese has melted. Stir through the cooked pasta.

6. To make the salad - combine the honey, cider vinegar and the remained 1 tbsp of mustard in a small bowl. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil and season the sauce with salt and pepper. Shred the little gem lettuce and thinly slice the peach. Add to a bowl and pour over the sauce. Crumble the feta and mix with the lettuce. 

7. Share the pasta and salad between two bowls and top with grated parmesam to finish.

"""What's for dinner?"" Said SNOWone ever with HelloFresh at their door! 

By the time the hubs gets home from work I feel like we are on full speed ahead mode and cooking dinner is just one more stressful task. It's a race I often lose. 

To say HelloFresh has cured my dinner time mama blues would be an understatement. The ability to have fresh, pre-measured ingredients deliver right to the door has been a dream come true. It's my #1 meal kit and allows me to include my kids in the cooking process. I'm so thankful for the recipe cards with all the ingredients listed, step by step directions, and there is a picture of what it's supposed to look like! Goals y'all goals. 

I'm all about helping other mamas out so use my code SIMPLYKATIELYNN10 to get 10 free meals across your 4 boxes with HelloFresh! Visit the link in my bio for more details!

"MOST people want to Stay consistent and ""Eat Better""

I'm Guessing a lot of people don't know where to Start and that's very common.
⠀
Consistency means having a plan.  A simple map that will help us ease into eating better.
⠀
The FIRST thing you need to do is simpler than you think.
⠀
First stop telling yourself I am going to try and eat better.  Trying is not set in stone.  Trying gives you the option to bail. Instead you have to take pen to paper and write down ""How"" you want to eat better.
⠀
⭐️And start making your plan from your goals.  What do these actions need to be in order for you to be consistent?
⠀
✅5k steps? Awesome
✅Drinking More Water
✅A balanced breakfast? 
✅Eating More Veggies. 
✅Meal prepping ahead

If I missed anything Comment Below👇

⠀
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT IT FEELS
⠀
What you're doing right now isn't working. Setting ridiculous targets that aren't achievable, so then you don't follow through and then you lose trust in yourself and then you wallow in self pity and then you get angry/unmotivated and set ANOTHER unrealistic promise to yourself.

These are 3 of my favorite nutrition habits that can create a more flexible mindset around food while creating more consistency overall.
⠀
💾Save💾 and use to your heart's delight (make sure you swipe for details)
⠀
👉🏼 I love to hear from my community on systems posts - what nutrition systems help you be more consistent?

"🌱 ❤️What a week❤️ The Friday 5ive could be all about #daughter1 and #cutefiance1 getting engaged, but buckle in, because I think they might be showing up here a lot in the near future. So, for now, my 5 for the week are.....

FAMILY/FRIENDS~since his mom and dad were getting engaged, I had @that__dood_iggy as a houseguest this week. He is all fun, love, and happiness💕

FITNESS~when I have a houseguest I like to plan fun outings. Because @that__dood_iggy likes to get outside and explore, I was able to get my steps in easily most days!

FOOD~I could present this gnocchi with spinach and grape tomatoes as my own curated meal, but anyone who knows me would quickly question that. So, full disclosure, this meal ( prepared by me) was via @hellofresh . It was indescribably good. The @cupcakewinery #rose was all my doing!

FUN FINDS~this is a @traderjoes haul full of fun finds, but the featured find is the bag itself! The “paper” bag is actually a vinyl reusable bag🤭 Fun, right?!? Oh, and all the other great finds will make their way to a post very soon. Stay tuned!

FASHION~loving the ease and convenience of @colorstreet nails! They are really easy to apply, and I get better applying them each time. These have been a great find!

"🍋HelloFresh

I wanted to make a lifestyle post today and talk about food (haha yes). 

Well, it’s been now three weeks that I’ve tested HelloFresh and honestly I love it. I love it because besides saving me a lot of time for grocery shopping:
🌿 I don’t have to think about what to cook tonight, 
🌿 I eat healthier, 
🌿 I discover new recipes, and that’s so great!

Before that, I was doing meal prep on Sunday for the week. It’s cool you really save a lot of time, money too but I love the fact of cooking fresh meals daily. 

So I really recommend HelloFresh for people who wants to discover new tastes or for people who don’t know how to cook (it’s honestly so easy).

Thank you for reading! I hope you liked it.",20,['#hellofresh #timesaver #timesaving #freshmeals #freshfood #healthy #healthyfood #originalrecipes #momworkingfromhome #momboss #momlife #momlifestyle #foodporn'],hellofresh

"Hello Fresh! So yummy story short, we had the delicious opportunity to try this Silky Sicilian Penne dinner from #hellofresh, & it was MadGud!  No celiacs were harmed in the making of this dinner, GF Ronzoni penne was substituted! 

So Jess got a coupon, the brown bag filled with ingredients arrived, her magic was worked, the card was followed, and dinner was served, 45min from prep to cook. (I was on snow duty 😳)

Thoughts - This service is extremely convenient and pricy, hence the convenience part. Especially with lil’ rug rats running around, it’s cool to have a cheat-sheet dinner, with a fully illustrated card & ingredients !!!

"Success!!!
.
For years, I have been trying to get better at cooking. But making food my husband will enjoy hasn't been easy. I took inspiration from my dad but he actually learned from watching shows on Food Network 🔪
.
You would think he would have taught me? Nope😥 instead, where I learned the best tricks was Hello Fresh🍋 Yes!!! That food delivery service you hear so much about 😁 making those meals taught me knife skills, where to use ingredients, and how to cook them. To this day, I will recreate those meals.
.
Where does your cooking inspiration come from?

"🍆Hello Fresh Lamb and Aubergine Curry🍆
Rating - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Enjoyed getting Hello Fresh this week and mixing things up! Our food hasn't been very photogenic but it was been super tasty 🤤
This lamb and aubergine curry had an amazing flavour, and was super easy to make - will definitely remake!
The only annoyance I've had with Hello Fresh is that the instructions tell you to chop/prep everything in advance - I prefer chopping as I go so I don't spend 5 minutes waiting around for each part to cook 😅

Whilst watching my True Crime on YouTube, I was bombarded with @hellofreshuk adverts do I decided to give it a go. 
Mate!  Best thing I ever did.  There’s no thinking behind the cooking and food doesn’t go to waste, as a result of cooking too much.

"Anime: Date A Live 3
Story .5/2 
Characters/Development 2/2
Animation 1/1
Music 0/1
Ending .5/1
Keeps You Entertained 0/2
Would Watch Again 0/1
Overall 4/10

4 out of 10 just like the animes episodes that actually matter. Yes In true Date A Live fashion on about 25% of the episodes matter at all to the overall plot. This season hit you with nostalgia because it's been away from us. It does not take long for you to remember that this is an etchi anime filled with big boobs and clingy harems. After about 2 to 3 episodes you lose all interest in the story, characters and so on why because the episodes dont matter. I could show you episodes 1 and 2 and 11 and 12 and you would still be able to understand how we got there. Date A Live has always made me have this love hate relationship with it. It teases me and I show my heart to it and it's like I dont want that kind of relationship were just friends and then you ignore it and it comes back like hey love me!!!!!! The downfall of DAL is that its storytelling has no length, it's not a big enough world/story to be an anime. A manga probably. I will say there is an episode I absolutely love just because of the aura/ambience of the episode. Kurimi is obviously still the best part of the show and honestly your money is there. You make an entire season focused on the final battle between spirits and kurimi getting her on there side and fighting the greater spirit we still know nothing about. It's time to end this anime, with that said a season 4 will be on the horizon, it's not gonna end it's stupid love romance with us like how it ended this season, so strap in folks were gonna do this again. Good luck.

"As requested I’m reviewing No Game No Life
▪️
▪️
I personally really liked this one, but it was quite short and it needs to have a second season
▪️
▪️
The concept is interesting, the fact that all conflict takes place through games makes anything makes the world quite fascinating, although I’m still confused about the different races and stuff like that. ▪️
▪️
Sora and Shiro were such a good pair although they are completely overpowered and never lose, still they made me laugh lots, the supporting characters were good too, with Jibril and Steph being my personal favourites, there wasn’t really much in term of an enemy  because even when they were competing they seemed friendly towards each other, although you could say that Tet is the overall villain in a way.
▪️
▪️
I thought the visuals were stunning and unique in a way, the opening song was also really memorable
▪️
▪️
Final Verdict: 8.5/10

"NO GAME NO LIFE ZERO
So I watched No Game No Life Zero Movie tonight and Good Lord it was a Masterpiece.
Movie is Canon and Covers Volume 6 of the Light Novels and Centers Around Riku and Shuvi (or Shwi) in a time 6,000 years before the Events of the Anime.
One hour and forty minutes of pure Eye Candy, Great Plot, 2 Amazing Main characters (I actually cried 😭 movie was full of feels) Voice acting was top notch as expected from the 2 leads. How the Events that happened in the Movie lead to where we are in the Anime is something that deserves applause. It gave alot if substance to the world of NGNL and all their races, gave an answer to alot of things regarding it as well including the only time the Game King didn't win in! 
All in all a masterclass of a movie by everyone's favorite Madhouse. If only they make sequels to their Anime

"Roses are red, violets are blue & our vibrant Thai curry is the perfect vegan option for two 💓 ...we know that was a little cheesy but if you can't do it at Valentine's when can you 🤷‍♀

This #Valentines, enjoy beetroot, butterbeans & sugar snap peas for a fresh spin 🌱 on this nutritious, yet delicious, recipe 😍 Hit SAVE to enjoy later 💃

WE DELIVER
200g beetroot
240g butter beans (drained)
10g toasted coconut chips
200ml coconut milk
2 garlic clove
4cm fresh ginger
1 lime
2 spring onion
100g black rice
1 shallot
80g sugar snap peas
2 tbsp red Thai curry paste

YOU COOK
1. Boil a kettle.
2. Add 600ml boiling water to a pan. Blanch the sugar snaps in the boiling water for 45 seconds, remove using a slotted spoon and plunge into ice-cold water; keep for later. Add the black rice to the same pan and cook for 25-30 mins, then drain and keep warm.
3. Peel the shallot and finely dice. Peel the garlic and finely chop. Peel the ginger and grate. Peel the beetroot and cut into 1.5cm dice.
4. Heat a medium-sized, non-stick pan with 1/2 tbsp oil on a medium-high heat. Add the shallot, garlic and ginger and cook for 3 mins. Add the curry paste and cook for a further minute, before adding the coconut milk, 200ml water and beetroot. Drain and rinse the butter beans and add to the sauce. Simmer for 15-20 mins, until the beetroot has cooked through.
5. Meanwhile, cut the lime into quarters. Finely slice the spring onions.
6. When ready to serve, add the sugar snaps and half the spring onions to the sauce to heat through. Squeeze in the juice from 2 lime wedges (to taste); season with sea salt and black pepper.

"You guys may have seen my stories yesterday about my food box from Mindful Chef, I was trying out a food box to see if it helps me reduce my food waste. The issue I talked about was the amount of plastic packaging these good boxes tend to come with, although it can really help reduce food waste, it feels like they are creating an issue of plastic waste instead. 

I had some great conversations with people about different experiences with these food boxes and I am going to continue researching and looking into something which can help me reduce my food waste but keep my plastic waste to a minimum also. I will keep you updated with my journey. 

I also really appreciated Mindful Chef reaching out to me and letting me know that they are working on having all their packaging home recyclable ASAP. This should have been done by now but due to covid-19, testing got delayed. 

My review so far on food boxes:

GOOD POINTS 
>In terms of the food, I got the vegan box and I love the recipes. I feel I have a really good range of fresh veg which will be great for my diet. 
>I also love that I can now eat more of the produce I was out off buying like Kale because I can only find it in big bags local to me which I cannot eat before going off. 
> There was a lot of packaging free produce which is good.
Definitely saves me time meal planning meaning I can focus on other things. 
> Can help with portion size which is another way to reduce food waste
>You get to try new recipes and new foods. 

BAD POINTS
>Still a lot of plastic involved. Things like spices which I already have in cupboard came in plastic pots which can be annoying when you literally have in packaging free right there in front of you.
>Cost is obviously more than if you bought those exact ingredients from your store but at least you have the recipe to hand now.

Being healthy in both body and mind should be a top priority for everyone, especially now, and UW have recognised that this is harder for some than it is for others. It is the small gestures such as these that can make a HUGE difference in someone's day.

What small gestures have made a difference to your lockdown experience? Let me know in the comments 👇

I had been putting off making these all week, thinking they would take a lot of effort. I wish I hadn't because they were so delicious. And not at all hard of faffy.
The falafels were easy to make and formed the shape with an ice cream scoop. They have a really nice flavour, with cumin and coriander and fresh parsley and the shakshuka works so well with it. Its a really rich tomato sauce that counteracts the dryness of the falafel.

I havent had a bad recipe from @mindfulchefuk - they just keeping creating amazing recipes!

To eat mindfully, is to recognize that all the parts of the digestive system are working in harmony to replenish the body. Starting with the mouth, chew carefully. Pick the right foods for the stomach, and take steps to keep the gut healthy. The body gives us subtle signs that we must learn to recognize. 

We are not only what we eat, but also how we eat it. See if you tend to eat when stressed or skip meals for work, or eat in excess/less because of a negative body image. Every body has its own needs, and identifying your own is the first step towards a healthy lifestyle. 

Once you know your body, you will know what to eat, when to eat it, and how much of it is necessary. Of course, there will be times when you shall indulge in your favorite dishes and desserts. The aim is to strike a balance.

"Made plans for Valentine's Day? ❤️ Bring the restaurant home with fragrant truffle oil & grass-fed British sirloin steak 🤤 Despite rich flavours this dish is still brimming with veg 🙌 including mustardy celeriac mash, earthy mushrooms & vitamin-dense purple sprouting broccoli 🥦 (meaning you'll still have room for dessert! 😋)
Order now to enjoy next weekend 👉 📦 

WE DELIVER
180g purple sprouting broccoli
400g celeriac
2 garlic clove
200g oyster mushrooms
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
1 handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 handful of fresh rosemary
2 x 150g sirloin steak
1 tbsp truffle oil

YOU COOK
1. Boil a kettle. Peel the celeriac and cut into 1 cm pieces; place in a saucepan. Cover with boiling water and simmer for 15-20 mins, until the celeriac has softened. Drain, place in a bowl and mash with a potato masher or with the back of a fork. Stir in the wholegrain mustard; season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover and set aside to keep warm.
2. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic. Slice the larger mushrooms in half. Trim the purple sprouting broccoli and cut any very thick stalks in half. Finely chop the parsley and rosemary leaves.
3. Heat a frying pan with 2 tsp oil on a medium heat. Season the steaks on both sides with sea salt and black pepper, then place in the pan. Cook until golden brown, 2-3 mins on each side for medium-rare or 4-5 mins on each side for well-done. Remove the steaks from the pan and leave to rest.
4. Boil another kettle. Add the purple sprouting broccoli to the same saucepan you used to cook the celeriac. Steam or simmer the broccoli in boiling water for 4-6 mins, until tender.
5. Meanwhile, in the same pan the steaks were in, heat 1 tsp oil on a medium-high heat. Cook the garlic, mushrooms, parsley and rosemary for 3 mins. Stir in the truffle oil; season with sea salt and black pepper.
6. Thinly slice the steaks. Spoon the celeriac mash onto warm plates, alongside the broccoli. Top the mash with the steak slices and spoon over the truffled mushrooms.",372,"['.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mindfulchef #mindfulchefuk #healthyeating #recipebox #mealkit #fooddelivery #healthyeats #healthyrecipes #healthyrecipe #healthymealideas #healthydinner #healthyfoodie #healthyliving #glutenfree #dairyfree #lowcarb #sugarfree #plantbased #cooking #healthymealideas #valentines #valentinesday #valentines2021 #truffe #steak #britishsteak #sirloinsteak #steakdinner #steaknight', ""Thanks for the freebies recently, they've been amazing!

Cook for your mother, to say thanks for all that she does. Cook for your friends and your loved one, to see a smile come across their face. Cook for yourself if that is what you love. Above all, learning to cook is a great way to grow. It may not come to you immediately, but as they say, practice makes perfect.

"Okay, so we know that gut health is important. But WHERE TO START?

I thought I'd just share a few of my personal daily gut-heath go-to's, the golden rules I have found help me the most. I hope it helps !

1. gluten: through endless experimentation & research, it has become so clear to how gluten effects me. I just feel so much lighter, less bloated, clearer when I eat other delicious grains & pulses instead!

2. Extra virgin olive oil: contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat which reduces inflammation and lowers your body's  PH-level (in which viruses & illness thrive), have anti-inflammatory properties, reduce bacterial overgrowth and helps the muscles & brain.

3. green tea, matcha & tulsi: antioxidants, and incredible anti-inflammatory effect, especially when replacing coffee

4. Chia & Linseed: anti-inflam. omega 3 (crucial if your vegan!), and high in gut-healing fibre, SO easy to sprinkle on any meal.

5. Garlic. if your partner eats it too, there's no problem ;) Insanely powerful natural prebiotic. (Don't overdo this one if you have IBS.)

6. Dark leafy greens: spinach, kale, calvo nero..in short, PACKED witht stuff you & your gut crave.

7. Herbal teas: don't underestimate the impotance of hydration, with healing herbs as a bonus and soothing warmth to help digestion.

8. eating early evening: so your tummy has less work at night and can focus on detoxification

9. ginger: anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, prebiotic,...basically good for everything! 

10. fresh herbs: extremely powerful antioxidant that just happened to add flavour to your food!

"Chilli goodness 🌶 

Chilli is also known as ‘Miris’ in Sinhalese (one of the languages spoken in Sri Lanka)

The spiciness of any chilli is derived from ""capsaicin"" within the peppers. This is more potent in the seed than in the outer segment of the peppers. 

Chillies are known to have Vit C, K1, A (the red chillies containing high beta carotene which converts to vitamin A), Lutein (mostly abundant in green immature chilli peppers), ferulic acid which is an antioxidant, copper and potassium and other minerals. 

The spiciness of chillies are known to have a thermogenic effect on our body, which is quite good to keep your metabolism active. 

Do note that many people who aren't used to it, too much spiciness and chillies could give you heartburn or you may feel the capsaicin effect a lot more. Always start with using it in small doses and increase as you go overtime to reach your comfort level, unlike when one was in University and trying to prove a point in a group, in ""who could eat the most number of raw chillies"". 🤦🏽‍♀️ 
The name of the game here isn't bravado, but in trying stuff that suits your own individuality for improving your health and food variety.

"Many people and specialist have been conditioned to think that a pill 💊 can fix all issues...

What is scary is that a quick fix in life or a band aid is never the or rarely the real solution. Instead it can become a bigger problem if taken for too long. 

We need to work together to change the way society thinks that a pill fixes all, rather than looking at our food source or how active we are. A good source of diverse variety of veggies, meats, fruits and carbs can really change the dial to give the nutrition your body needs to fight an anomaly in your body. 

The quote from Dr. B.M. Hegde enlightens the whole system in a sentence. 

(Do watch @drbmhegde Talk on TEDx Mite - it is a good listen)

The many side effects that comes with taking a pill is almost always disregarded as the benefits being greater. But being dependant on a pill or medication for the rest of your life isn’t. 
So think about how it affects your body and gut  microbes, speak to your naturopaths, nutritionist and GP’s about the impacts. Or find a specialist that would explain this too you.

"In a culture where ordering in has become the norm, cooking for oneself and others can seem a little strange. After all, work leaves us anxious and stressed, and it can be a little difficult to see how we are going to have the time to prepare our meals by ourselves. 

It is all possible if we put our minds to it. Even if you have never stepped into the kitchen before, the journey towards Mindful cooking is therapeutic. On the way, you shall notice changes – in your attitude towards life and work, in your daily routine and your relationships, because cooking is an investment in oneself. It teaches you to be self-sufficient and plan your day better.

1. Digestion of food

2. Assimilation & absorption of nutrients 

3. Immune regulation (70% of our immune system in our gut!)

4. Symbiosis with gut bacteria (hello hormones!)

5. Detoxification & elimination of waste/toxins

5. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp water and the spinach in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Cook the spinach for 1 minute, until wilted, then add the rice. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Cook for a further 3-4 mins, stirring often, until piping hot. Keep warm.
6. Add the coconut milk and baby plum tomatoes to the pan with the chicken. Bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium heat for 5 mins, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency and the chicken is cooked through. Meanwhile, place the flaked almonds on a baking tray and spread them out evenly. Cook in the oven for 3 mins, until toasted.
7. Season the curry with sea salt and black pepper. Spoon the spinach rice between warm bowls and serve with the chicken pasanda curry. Sprinkle the toasted almonds and remaining coriander over the top.",156,"['.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#mindfulchef #mindfulchefuk #healthyeating #recipebox #mealkit #fooddelivery #healthyeats #healthyrecipes #healthyrecipe #healthymealideas #healthydinner #healthyfoodie #healthyliving #glutenfree #dairyfree #lowcarb #sugarfree #macros #plantbased #cooking #healthymealideas #chickenrecipes #chickencurry #chickencurryrecipe #cookalong #livecooking #livecookingclass #livecookingshow #livecookingdemo', 'do you have a full range of dairy and gluten free meals?

"Red Thai broth with lemongrass tofu - beautiful recipe from @mindfulchefuk 

First time I have cooked with tofu and it was so good. The other half even ate it and said how tasty it was. 
The flavours in this are delicious and work well with all the fresh vegetables. 
Think this will remain a firm staple of mine.

"Each year, the @british_heart_foundation (BHF) declares February as #NationalHeartMonth in the UK. During this time, awareness of a variety of heart conditions are bought to the fore with National Heart Month.

Many of us have heard of diseases relating to the heart and circulation and refer to these as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or heart disease. However, there are many different types of heart conditions and problems.

Understanding heart conditions is an incredibly difficult task – there are lots of different types and understanding how the heart works is more helpful when trying to learn about these conditions.  But looking at the facts will benefit yourself, your employees and the people you love in the long run.

To help Quality Care Devon support BHF we urge you to go and take a look at their website to find out what amazing work they do and how you can help support them, they have activities and promotions throughout February from companies such as @mintvelvet @emma_bridgewater @mindfulchefuk and many more!

This retrograde will be from Jan. 30th through Feb. 20th and we can expect a much slower period energetically.  And this time is a reminder for me to slow down, be mindful of all I do and to allow for some extra rest and patience🙏🏻

It’s the perfect time to get back into a consistent meditation practice whether that’s just 5 minutes a day!🙏🏻

Use this time to go inward and be mindful of everything moving in a slower pace, make sure you stay hydrated and cleanse.

"🌸Nothing says #Spring quite like #asparagus and #sweetpeas! ☀️And now that the weather has caught up to the calendar- it’s most def time for Spring #food! 😁
In 🗽New York we can pretty much get ANY produce ANY time of the year. Yet if you want the best 🤤tasting #fruits and #veggies🍐 - buy in season! 🚚Long distance travel is not the exception, but the rule when it comes to #supermarket produce. 💨Much of our food is picked unripe, and then “gassed” to ripen in transit, which results in produce that doesn’t taste quite the way #nature intended. 😮
👍🏻Solution A) 🌱grow some of your own! It doesn’t take much space for a tomato plant, or herbs, or #greens, even for 🏙city dwellers.  Give it a shot!
👍🏻Solution B) 👩🏻‍🌾#FarmersMarket. Usually (but not always) those farmers have recently harvested and not travelled cross country to deliver their yumminess. 💸But, granted,that can get quite pricy. 👍🏻Solution C) 🌗🌑🌒shop seasonal!!
