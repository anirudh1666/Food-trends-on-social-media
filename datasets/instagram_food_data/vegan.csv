#nofilter ☺🌱☺🌱☺🌱☺

Good morning🙈
Today, I had this delicious plate for breakfast☺ It has been the first time I made this dish and I love it!!! 
For the scrambled Tofu I squeezed to water out of the tofu (100g). Then, I cut an red onion (20g) which I fried in a pan. I usually do not use oil, because I do not really notice a difference, but you can use oil if you want to. When the onion is brown, shred the tofu with your hands and add it to the onion. Add some spices (I used curry, curcuma, salt, pepper and nutmeg). After 3 minutes, add 20g soy yoghurt to the tofu mix and heat it up for 2 more minutes. Thats it! Enjoy it☺

2,"🤔 When most people think of probiotics, they think of bacteria capsules that aid in digestion and bowel movements. However, that is actually a tiny portion of what they do.
Most people don’t know this, but your gut is home to 80% of your immune system. In fact, your body’s overall health is directly determined by the health of your gut and the type of bacteria living there. Neglecting it can lead to many health situations down the road, each much more uncomfortable than mere indigestion.
You see, your gut exists to eliminate toxins. It’s the primary detox pathway of your body. And good bacteria (probiotics) are what help make this possible. But, if you’re lacking these good bacteria and have an overabundance of bad (disease-causing) bacteria, your gut cannot eliminate the toxins in it. This is a big problem for your gut. The toxins have to go somewhere.
And they do — your body reabsorbs them.
This condition is called auto-intoxication. These toxins then build up in your liver, your lymphatic system, and your skin. They’re actually poisoning you.
The best solution to solve this is a high-quality probiotic that contains a variety of live probiotics and soil-based organisms (spore biotics) to help you recondition your gut and support the growth of new, good bacteria.
So.... 
The health of your body is directly affected by the health of your gut. If you’re not taking a really good probiotic, you need to start. I highly recommend you get Perfect Immune Defense Probiotics ( @bodyhealthoptimized ) take them every day, and set yourself on the road to a healthier gut and a healthier life.

6,"It’s Chinese New Year tomorrow but not being able to go home, let alone go out has really dampened the mood to celebrate. I was determined to make something and thought of a northern Malaysian savoury biscuit. 

Tau sar piah is mung bean paste wrapped in a crust. The filling is crumbly but not dry, and the pastry is light and flakey. 

This isn’t typically a Chinese New Year snack but I fell in love with it as a kid when we visited relatives in the north for new year. It was imperative that we would bring home a couple of boxes of biscuits. This reminds me of celebrating CNY with my family and I’m glad I could recreate a little piece of my childhood memories. 

If you’re celebrating CNY/LNY, I hope it is a wonderful season for you and your loved ones despite the circumstances we are facing now. Gong xi fa chai!

0,"I hear the arguments of vegan people all around me in social media and in person and would like to throw my 2 cents in.

Animals have developed in, on, and around us humans for tens of thousands of years. Which means that our body’s system developed with them and they developed with us. We created a mutual interdependence relationship. Cutting them out of our life’s is cruel to them and unhealthy for our organism.

Diets that are high in carbs are associated with a slew of diseases from SIBO, diabetics to other autoimmune diseases.

It was just about 150 years ago that each household cared for their own animals. Animals were butchered, cleaned, and prepared at home. It is interesting for me that at the time people did not advocate for plant based diet. At least not as loud as today. Today, we totally separate the meat from the animal. We buy meat wrapped in plastic, so disconnected from the live animal and we nevertheless have a strong advocates for vegan diet. Is there a connection between the two?

We also became a culture that is afraid of death. We ignore death in the way we live our life. We seem to be surprised by it when it comes. Death is part of life. It is the how you live and how you die that is important, for us and for animals. 

What do I do?
I buy my meat from local farmers. I know that the animals lived good life mostly in pasture (I buy 100% pasture raised) and died in grace
I eat meat daily but in small amounts. The majority of my plate is veggies. They are living sentient beings too by the way.

11,"This evening my friend Ehud from The Left Handed Chef put up a post that made me feel sad. It was quite simply a photo of his completely empty restaurant. That was his dinner service tonight. Not one customer. It’s a Thursday in Melbourne, warm and balmy summer weather, the perfect night to be out eating the delicious Israeli food he serves. But this is how it is now thanks to COVID. There is no rhyme or reason for anything anymore, it’s pretty much expect the unexpected and don’t bother planning ahead and that is what is most distressing for the hospitality industry. Ehud is a fighter, he doesn’t complain but he tells it like it is. He comes from a country where people are strong and they don’t give up and he sure as hell isn’t going to let a pandemic beat him.

And so just to show my support for my friend, I wanted to share this photo of the beautiful lunch I had there last week with my friend Amanda who was down visiting from Sydney. I was busting to try the new menu item, this absolutely stunning Cabbage Shawarma Steak topped with chickpeas, crispy kale, tomato & pickled red onion salad and served with yoghurt, harissa, and zhug (green chilli). I was really hoping it was going be good but it was even more awesome than I expected. For those of you looking for a vegetarian or vegan (hold the yoghurt) option this is a ripper. I ate this on my own but it’s perfect as part of a sharing menu as it’s so bloody filling.

If you haven’t been to visit Ehud and Holly in a while, now is time to go and show your support to them and small businesses like theirs in general. We all seem to think that because life is back to some sense of normality that it’s like this across the board but from what I have seen around me it’s just not the case and we have a long road of recovery ahead.

11,"If you're someone who doesn't enjoy oily/balm cleansers but need something more natural, vegan and currently free to take your make up off then - well here you go! I was sent a bottle of this gorgeous micellar water from @islarosa.co months ago, to try out on my sensitive eczema prone face. I have to say after using it all up (well, nearly - I dropped my bottle just as I was at the last bit! 🥴) my skin and I really enjoyed it. 😻

 It doesn't contain any extra unnecessary fragrance or alcohol, but it does contain some very nourishing Aloe Vera & Blueberry extract along with toning Witch Hazel. I used it on my eyes at night on a reusable cotton pad (from @hollandandbarrett ) to remove makeup, and after a double cleanse my skin always felt really clean. It didn't sting my eyes and I often used it as a toner in the morning too if I didn't have time to do a wash with water. ✨

They package everything in recyclable cardboard and the gorgeous glass bottles are perfect to refill or reuse, maybe for decorations or gifts? The unbleached/unwaxed paper label can just be washed off and will biodegrade. 💁♻️

The products are carefully handmade in Scotland and come in two sizes (the smaller size is perfect for travel or gifting). They didn't ask or expect me to say anything here, this is just an honest little review for y'all! 🥰

18,"PESTO STUFFED MUSHROOMS

I was in the mood for making another batch of my favourite vegan pesto, but didn't know what to serve it with. That's when I came across the idea of stuffed mushrooms. So quick and easy and full of flavour. In short: the perfect appetizer!

➡️ Swipe to see how I made the pesto

Ingredients:

🌱 24 whole fresh mushrooms
🌱 3 tbsp nutrional yeast
🌱 5 tbsp (30g) pine nuts + extra for garnish
🌱 1 garlic clove
🌱 1 + 1/2 cup (30g) basil leaves
🌱 1/3 cup (75ml) olive oil
🌱 Juice from 1/2 lemon
🌱 Salt and pepper to taste
🌱 Bread crumbs

Instructions:

🍄 Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C)
🍄 Mix all the ingredients for the pesto in the food processor
🍄 Carefully remove the stems of the mushrooms and get the dirt off the caps with a damp tissue
🍄 Bake the mushrooms caps for 10 min in the oven
🍄 Take the shrooms out the oven and drain the juices. Stuff them with the homemade pesto and top with bread crumbs and 1 pine nut
🍄 Bake again for approx. 8min until  browned
🍄 Enjoy!

7,"APPLE BASED ‘OATS’

OII OIIII dairy free moots 👋🏼 
Want to pimp up your breakfast? Here’s a good one for you. I saw someone make “oats” out of apples and I gave my own twist to it. The yoghurt makes it extremely creamy but you still have that apple crunch 😋🍎

3,"Why soy candles ??

Soy wax candles generally burn longer than paraffin candles.

Soy wax is derived from natural vegetables while paraffin is a refined gasoline by-product. Paraffin has been correlated with health implications such as breast cancer and ADHD. 

Soy wax is 100% biodegradable while paraffin was is not. 

Soy wax spills clean up simply with soap and water while paraffin wax spills are very time consuming and extremely difficult to completely clean up if at all. 

Soy wax releases fragrance easier than paraffin candles.

👩 I have lately been thinking of my voice in activism online. I’m so afraid to say something wrong or stupid that I often end up saying nothing at all. And that’s really unfortunate because I have lots of strong political opinions and it’s so easy for me to talk about in real life - but in writing and online I just feel clueless. Everyone know what I’m talking about? Tips is highly appreciated! 🥳

4,"Which dishes do you deconstruct to recreate traditional flavors without all the hard labor?  The first dish I deconstructed was stuffed zucchini.  The flavor was not as delicate but it cut the prep time by ¾!  All stuffed dishes can be deconstructed.  This one is a stuffed swiss chard deconstruction.  Lebanese stuff swiss chard with rice meat and onions or rice tomato, onion, and parsley.  But rather than wrapping the stuffing, I simply chop roughly the swiss chard leaves nd cook with the liquid and the stuffing.  The secret to the vegan version is a generous dose of lemon juice and olive oil added to the cooking mix. I used quinoa because of a rice allergy but the rice tastes a lot better.  And of course wrapped it is even tastier. But c'est la vie. Maybe I will do that one day when am feeding anymore a ravenous teenager on a mostly veggies diet. #allergenfree #cookingathome #thefeedfeed #recipe #homecooking #glutenfree #saludable #foodporn #recetas #eatmoreplants #paleo #recipe #plantbasedfood #veganish #vegan #miami #cookingathome #vegetarian #recetas #recettes #eatmoreplants #worldcuisine #global #fusioncuisine #mediterranean #couscous #swisschard #chickpeas  #레시피 #음식 #طبخ"

7,"3 top tips to form good nutritional habits! 💪

At Equilibrium Studios we like to follow the @precisionnutrition philosophy and help coach our clients into forming life changing habits! 

Today I would like to share with you on how you can begin to make changes to your nutrition and make that permanent change! 

In order to form a good habit you need to focus on repetition of the same practice. Research has shown that if we repeat a process consistently it is more likely to become second nature! 

Tip number 1 - make it simple! 👍
When looking to change our behaviours it is important to remember that if the practice is too tough we simply won’t follow it. Feel free to scale back any daily practices such as “eating enough protein” to suit you so that you can remain consistent.

Tip number 2 - keep consistency! 🔑
If you are looking to make these changes, one of the most important aspects is consistency. Take playing a musical Instrument for example, if you don’t practise playing how will you ever get better! This same principle applies with our daily nutritional choices. If we practise consistently then you will improve and get better at making healthy choices.

Tip number 3 - don’t reflect on the past! 
When forming good nutritional habits you may find yourself slip on some days and that’s ok! It is important to always focus on the now and what you can do today that is going to push you closer to your goals. Try to keep a mindset of “how can I be 1% better than yesterday”. That way you will be able to make little progress each and every day which will lead to that goal you have been wanting to achieve for so long! 

I hope these tips are useful and help you to take action on your nutritional habits habits from today! 💪",#nutrition #fitness #health #healthylifestyle #healthy #healthyfood #weightloss #diet #motivation #workout #gym #fit #wellness #food #lifestyle #fitnessmotivation #healthyliving #habits #healthyeating #fitfam #vegan #protein #training #exercise #healthyhabits #eatclean #personaltrainer #foodie #weightlossjourney #bhfyp,Super❤️ DM your pic for promotion 😍

Prepare a confectionery sleeve with a rounded star tip. Put the dough into the prepared sleeve. Carefully pipe mixture into preheated oil, you can cut end with clean scissors. Squeeze the dough into the hot oil, you can cut end with scissors. Let fry about 2 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to dry briefly.

12,"Dried legumes have long eluded us. Don’t ask about the time we tried to boil bulk bin–black beans for nearly eight hours, until we gave up on using them. 

But chickpeas are the exception. Creamy and tender, this versatile ingredient never disappoints, whether blended into hummus, simmered, or crisped under the broiler and consumed at cocktail hour.

There are several excellent ways to cook chickpeas, from stovetop to Instant Pot—just don’t skimp on the soaking. (Or, if you do, be prepared to make up for it with extra cooking time, and a more taxing skin-removal process, if skinless chickpeas are your thing.)",#food #middleeastern #middleeasternfood #middleeasterncuisine #foodfinds #london #londonlife #foodlondon #foodielondon #londonfoodies #foodinlondon #londonfood #londonfoodie #vegetarian #vegetarianfood #vegetariana #vegetarianos #vegetarianfoodporn #vegetarianlifestyle #vegan #veganfood #veganfit #veganmealideas
